## ðŸŒŸ North Star Principles

1. **Simplify, Simplify, Simplify**: Every decision should make the code simpler, not more complex
2. **No Cruft**: Remove all redundant code, validation, and unnecessary complexity
3. **Break It & Fix It Right**: No backwards compatibility shims - make breaking changes and migrate properly
4. **Long-term Elegance**: Choose performant, compiler-enforced solutions that prevent subtle bugs
5. **Backend-Driven**: Let the backend handle complexity, frontend should be a thin client
6. **Single Source of Truth**: One pattern, one way to do things, no alternatives
7. **No Over-Engineering**: Design for current needs only - no hypothetical features, no "maybe later" code
