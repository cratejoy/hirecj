# Grounding Knowledge Implementation Plan ✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented a clean and elegant pattern to embed "grounding knowledge" from LightRAG knowledge graphs into agents and workflows using `{{grounding: <namespace>}}` syntax.

## Summary
The grounding system allows agents to dynamically query knowledge graphs based on conversation context. When a prompt or workflow contains `{{grounding: npr}}`, the system will:
1. Extract the directive and parse any parameters
2. Build a context-aware query from recent conversation messages
3. Query the specified knowledge graph via the knowledge service
4. Cache results for 30 minutes to improve performance
5. Replace the directive with formatted knowledge content

This enables agents to have access to specialized knowledge bases without hardcoding information in prompts.

## Architecture Components

### 1. GroundingManager Service (`agents/app/services/grounding_manager.py`)
- Extract grounding directives from templates
- Query knowledge graphs with conversation context
- Cache results for performance
- Handle graceful degradation

### 2. Knowledge Service Client (`agents/app/services/knowledge_client.py`)
- HTTP client for knowledge service API
- Async query methods
- Namespace validation
- Error handling

### 3. Template Processing Enhancement
- Extend existing template parsing
- Support `{{grounding: npr}}` syntax
- Options: limit, mode

### 4. Integration Points
- CJAgent: Process grounding in `_build_context()`
- WorkflowLoader: Support grounding in workflow YAML
- MessageProcessor: Maintain grounding context

## Implementation Steps

1. [x] Create plan.md
2. [x] Add knowledge service URL to config
3. [x] Create KnowledgeServiceClient
4. [x] Create GroundingManager
5. [x] Update CJAgent to process grounding
6. [x] Update WorkflowLoader for workflow grounding
7. [x] Add tests
8. [x] Create example demonstrating usage

## Next Steps for Production Use

1. Ensure knowledge service is running on port 8004
2. Create knowledge graphs using the knowledge service API
3. Add `{{grounding: namespace}}` to prompts or workflows
4. Monitor logs for grounding performance and cache hits

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Configuration
- Added `knowledge_service_url` to `agents/app/config.py`
- Default: `http://localhost:8004`
- Environment variable: `KNOWLEDGE_SERVICE_URL`

### 2. KnowledgeServiceClient (`agents/app/services/knowledge_client.py`)
- Async HTTP client for knowledge service
- Methods: `query()`, `check_namespace_exists()`, `get_namespace_status()`
- Graceful error handling with logging

### 3. GroundingManager (`agents/app/services/grounding_manager.py`)
- Extracts grounding directives from templates
- Supports syntax: `{{grounding: namespace}}` with optional params
- Parameters: `limit` (message count), `mode` (query mode)
- Builds context-aware queries from conversation history
- 30-minute result caching for performance

### 4. CJAgent Integration
- Added `_process_grounding()` method
- Processes grounding in both prompts and workflow details
- Graceful degradation if knowledge service unavailable
- Maintains async pattern with proper event loop handling

### 5. WorkflowLoader Enhancement
- Automatically adds grounding directives from workflow YAML
- New method `get_workflow_grounding()` for namespace retrieval
- Workflow YAML format:
  ```yaml
  grounding:
    - npr
    - docs
  ```

### 6. Tests
- Created `test_grounding_manager.py` with comprehensive test coverage
- Tests directive extraction, query building, caching, and full flow

## Design Principles
- Simple and elegant
- Context-aware queries using chat history
- Async throughout
- Graceful degradation
- Cacheable results

## ✅ Synchronous Conversion (Latest Update)
Successfully converted the entire grounding system from async to synchronous for determinism:
- **KnowledgeServiceClient**: Now uses synchronous `httpx.Client` instead of async
- **GroundingManager**: `process_grounding()` is now synchronous
- **CJAgent**: Removed `asyncio.run()` calls, now calls synchronous methods directly
- **Tests**: Updated all tests to work with synchronous implementation
- **Result**: All tests passing, example working correctly, no event loop issues

This conversion was done to avoid async complexity and ensure deterministic behavior as requested.
