# HireCJ Development Plan

## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ Completed Phases

1. **Phase 1: Foundation** ✅
   - Onboarding workflow, CJ agent, OAuth button component
   - [📄 Detailed Documentation](docs/shopify-onboarding/phase-1-foundation.md)

2. **Phase 2: Auth Flow Integration** ✅
   - OAuth callbacks, shop domain identifier, context updates
   - [📄 Detailed Documentation](docs/shopify-onboarding/phase-2-auth-flow.md)

3. **Phase 3.7: OAuth 2.0 Implementation** ✅
   - Full OAuth flow with HMAC verification, token storage
   - [📄 Detailed Documentation](docs/shopify-onboarding/phase-3.7-oauth-implementation.md)
   - See also: [Phase 3 OAuth Production](docs/shopify-onboarding/phase-3-oauth-production.md), [Phase 3 Testing](docs/shopify-onboarding/phase-3-testing.md)

4. **Phase 4.0: True Environment Centralization** ✅
   - Single .env pattern with automatic distribution
   - [📄 Detailed Documentation](docs/phase-4.0-env-centralization.md)

5. **Phase 4.1: UI Actions Pattern** ✅
   - Parser, workflow config, WebSocket integration
   - [📄 Detailed Documentation](docs/shopify-onboarding/phase-4-ui-actions.md)

6. **Phase 4.5: User Identity & Persistence** ✅
   - PostgreSQL user identity, fact storage, session management
   - [📄 Detailed Documentation](docs/shopify-onboarding/phase-4.5-user-identity.md)

7. **Phase 4.6: System Events Architecture** ✅
   - YAML-based system event handling for OAuth responses
   - [📄 Detailed Documentation](docs/shopify-onboarding/phase-4.6-system-events.md)

8. **Phase 4.6.5: Workflow-Driven Requirements** ✅
   - All workflow requirements moved to YAML files
   - All workflow behavior moved to YAML files (Phase 2.5)
   - Zero hardcoded workflow logic remaining
   - Backend serves requirements to frontend
   - Enhanced debug interface for troubleshooting

9. **Phase 4.7: Backend-Authoritative User Identity** ✅
   - Verified backend is sole authority for user ID generation
   - Frontend never generates user IDs (only conversation/message IDs)
   - All services use shared.user_identity module
   - User IDs follow consistent format: usr_xxxxxxxx
   - No changes needed - system already correctly implemented

### ⏳ In Progress

None - ready for next phase!

### 📅 Upcoming Phases

1. **Phase 5: Quick Value Demo** (4 hours) - **UPDATED FOR WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE**
   - Show immediate value after Shopify connection via workflow-driven insights
   - OAuth completion handled through system events in YAML
   - Progressive data disclosure using shopify_insights tool (not hardcoded methods)
   - Workflow-driven behavior configuration for natural pacing
   - Smooth transition to ad_hoc_support workflow
   - [📄 Detailed Documentation](docs/shopify-onboarding/phase-5-quick-value.md) ✨ Updated

## 🏗️ Phase 5 Architecture Update Summary

Phase 5 has been redesigned to fully integrate with our workflow-driven architecture:

1. **System Events for OAuth**: OAuth completion triggers insights through workflow YAML configuration
2. **Tool-Based Approach**: Created `shopify_insights` tool instead of hardcoded CJ agent methods
3. **Progressive Disclosure in YAML**: CJ's behavior for revealing insights is configured in the workflow
4. **Consistent Pattern**: Follows the same pattern as our universe data tools
5. **Zero Hardcoded Logic**: All behavior driven by YAML configuration

This maintains our commitment to backend-driven, workflow-configured architecture while delivering immediate value to merchants.

## 🌟 North Star Principles

1. **Simplify, Simplify, Simplify**: Every decision should make the code simpler, not more complex
2. **No Cruft**: Remove all redundant code, validation, and unnecessary complexity
3. **Break It & Fix It Right**: No backwards compatibility shims - make breaking changes and migrate properly
4. **Long-term Elegance**: Choose performant, compiler-enforced solutions that prevent subtle bugs
5. **Backend-Driven**: Let the backend handle complexity, frontend should be a thin client
6. **Single Source of Truth**: One pattern, one way to do things, no alternatives
7. **No Over-Engineering**: Design for current needs only - no hypothetical features
8. **Thoughtful Logging & Instrumentation**: Appropriate visibility into system behavior

## 🚨 What We're NOT Building

- **No** complex state management libraries
- **No** over-abstraction of simple concepts
- **No** backwards compatibility with old hardcoded system
- **No** frontend-specific workflow knowledge
- **No** special cases or exceptions

Focus: Backend-driven, YAML-configured, simple and elegant solutions.
