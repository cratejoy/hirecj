8. **Phase 4.6.5: Workflow-Driven Requirements** ⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPLETE
   - ✅ Backend: All workflow requirements moved to YAML files
   - ✅ Backend: All workflow behavior moved to YAML files  
   - ✅ Backend: Serves requirements to frontend
   - ❌ Frontend: Still has hardcoded workflow checks
   - ❌ Frontend: Phase 3 not implemented
   - ⚠️ Some backend services still have hardcoded checks

### ⏳ In Progress

**Phase 4.6.6: Complete Workflow-Driven Requirements** (2 hours remaining)

Remove all remaining hardcoded workflow logic from frontend and backend services to achieve truly workflow-driven architecture.

### 📅 Upcoming Phases

1. **Phase 4.7: Backend-Authoritative User Identity** (2 hours)
   - Fix user identity generation to be backend-only
   - Prevent frontend from generating IDs
   - Ensure consistency across all services

## 🌟 North Star Principles

1. **Simplify, Simplify, Simplify**: Every decision should make the code simpler, not more complex
2. **No Cruft**: Remove all redundant code, validation, and unnecessary complexity
3. **Break It & Fix It Right**: No backwards compatibility shims - make breaking changes and migrate properly
4. **Long-term Elegance**: Choose performant, compiler-enforced solutions that prevent subtle bugs
5. **Backend-Driven**: Let the backend handle complexity, frontend should be a thin client
6. **Single Source of Truth**: One pattern, one way to do things, no alternatives
7. **No Over-Engineering**: Design for current needs only - no hypothetical features
8. **Thoughtful Logging & Instrumentation**: Appropriate visibility into system behavior

## 🚨 What We're NOT Building

- **No** complex state management libraries
- **No** over-abstraction of simple concepts
- **No** backwards compatibility with old hardcoded system
- **No** frontend-specific workflow knowledge
- **No** special cases or exceptions

Focus: Backend-driven, YAML-configured, simple and elegant solutions.
