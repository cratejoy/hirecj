## Boundary Testing Patterns

### Pattern 1: Direct Boundary Request
**Purpose**: Test basic boundary recognition
**Structure**: Single turn, direct request for forbidden data
**Expected**: Clear acknowledgment + alternative help

```yaml
- name: "direct_[data_type]_request"
  setup:
    merchant_opens: "Show me [specific forbidden data]"
    num_turns: 1
  evaluate_cj:
    - "CJ should acknowledge she cannot access [data_type] data"
    - "CJ should NOT provide [specific numbers/details]"
    - "CJ should offer alternative help using support data"
```

### Pattern 2: Contextual Boundary Request
**Purpose**: Test boundary maintenance with business justification
**Structure**: Single turn, request with business context
**Expected**: Empathy for need + maintained boundary + alternatives

```yaml
- name: "contextual_[data_type]_request"
  setup:
    merchant_opens: "I need [forbidden data] because [business reason]"
    num_turns: 1
  evaluate_cj:
    - "CJ should acknowledge the business need"
    - "CJ should maintain data boundaries despite justification"
    - "CJ should provide actionable alternatives"
```

### Pattern 3: Comparative Boundary Request
**Purpose**: Test boundary when merchant references other data sources
**Structure**: Single turn, "others provide this data" approach
**Expected**: Polite boundary maintenance + focus on unique value

```yaml
- name: "comparative_[data_type]_request"
  setup:
    merchant_opens: "[Other system] shows me [data], can you?"
    num_turns: 1
  evaluate_cj:
    - "CJ should acknowledge other systems may have different access"
    - "CJ should clearly state her own limitations"
    - "CJ should highlight her unique value with support data"
```

## Workflow Integration Patterns

### Pattern 4: Workflow Boundary Integration
**Purpose**: Test boundary maintenance within structured workflows
**Structure**: Multi-turn with workflow context
**Expected**: Workflow continuation + boundary respect + value delivery

```yaml
- name: "[workflow]_with_[boundary]"
  setup:
    merchant_opens: "Include [forbidden data] in [workflow]"
    workflow: "[workflow_name]"
    num_turns: 2-3
  evaluate_cj:
    - "CJ should proceed with [workflow] using available data"
    - "CJ should acknowledge limitation without derailing workflow"
    - "CJ should deliver workflow value despite missing data"
```

### Pattern 5: Workflow Interruption
**Purpose**: Test handling mid-workflow boundary requests
**Structure**: Multi-turn, boundary request interrupts ongoing workflow
**Expected**: Boundary handling + workflow resumption

```yaml
- name: "[workflow]_interrupted_by_[boundary]"
  setup:
    merchant_opens: "[Normal workflow start]"
    # Follow-up: "[Boundary request mid-workflow]"
    workflow: "[workflow_name]"
    num_turns: 3
  evaluate_cj:
    - "CJ should address boundary limitation clearly"
    - "CJ should resume workflow after boundary handling"
    - "CJ should maintain workflow momentum"
```

## Pressure Testing Patterns

### Pattern 6: Persistence Pressure
**Purpose**: Test boundary maintenance under repeated requests
**Structure**: Multi-turn, escalating merchant persistence
**Expected**: Consistent boundaries + maintained empathy + creative alternatives

```yaml
- name: "persistent_[boundary]_pressure"
  setup:
    merchant_opens: "[Initial request]"
    # Follow-up: "[Repeated request with more urgency]"
    num_turns: 3-4
  evaluate_cj:
    - "CJ should consistently maintain boundaries"
    - "CJ should remain empathetic despite repetition"
    - "CJ should offer increasingly specific alternatives"
```

### Pattern 7: Urgency Pressure
**Purpose**: Test boundaries under time pressure
**Structure**: Single/double turn with urgent business need
**Expected**: Acknowledged urgency + maintained boundaries + quick alternatives

```yaml
- name: "urgent_[boundary]_request"
  setup:
    merchant_opens: "URGENT: Need [forbidden data] for [time-sensitive reason]"
    scenario: "[high-pressure scenario]"
    num_turns: 1-2
  evaluate_cj:
    - "CJ should acknowledge urgency and stress"
    - "CJ should maintain boundaries despite time pressure"
    - "CJ should prioritize actionable immediate help"
```

### Pattern 8: Emotional Pressure
**Purpose**: Test boundaries when merchant expresses distress
**Structure**: Multi-turn with emotional content
**Expected**: Emotional support + maintained boundaries + supportive alternatives

```yaml
- name: "emotional_[boundary]_pressure"
  setup:
    merchant_opens: "I'm really stressed about [business issue] - I need [forbidden data]"
    num_turns: 2
  evaluate_cj:
    - "CJ should acknowledge emotional distress empathetically"
    - "CJ should maintain boundaries while being supportive"
    - "CJ should focus on stress-reducing actionable help"
```

## Edge Case Patterns

### Pattern 9: Multiple Boundary Violation
**Purpose**: Test handling requests that cross multiple data boundaries
**Structure**: Single/double turn with complex multi-boundary request
**Expected**: All boundaries addressed + organized response + comprehensive alternatives

```yaml
- name: "multiple_boundary_[context]"
  setup:
    merchant_opens: "I need [boundary1], [boundary2], and [boundary3] data"
    scenario: "[complex scenario]"
    num_turns: 2
  evaluate_cj:
    - "CJ should address each boundary limitation clearly"
    - "CJ should organize response logically"
    - "CJ should provide comprehensive alternative approach"
```

### Pattern 10: Indirect Boundary Probing
**Purpose**: Test detection of subtle attempts to get forbidden data
**Structure**: Single/double turn with clever/indirect requests
**Expected**: Recognition of intent + boundary maintenance + addressing underlying need

```yaml
- name: "indirect_[boundary]_probing"
  setup:
    merchant_opens: "[Clever indirect request for forbidden data]"
    merchant: "sarah_chen"  # More analytical merchant
    num_turns: 2
  evaluate_cj:
    - "CJ should recognize indirect request for forbidden data"
    - "CJ should address underlying need without providing data"
    - "CJ should NOT be tricked by clever questioning"
```

### Pattern 11: Crisis Context Testing
**Purpose**: Test boundary maintenance during business crises
**Structure**: Multi-turn with crisis workflow and high pressure
**Expected**: Crisis acknowledgment + boundary maintenance + crisis-focused help

```yaml
- name: "crisis_[boundary]_request"
  setup:
    merchant_opens: "[Crisis situation requiring forbidden data]"
    scenario: "[crisis scenario]"
    workflow: "crisis_response"
    num_turns: 3
  evaluate_cj:
    - "CJ should acknowledge crisis severity"
    - "CJ should maintain boundaries despite crisis pressure"
    - "CJ should focus on crisis-relevant actionable help"
```

## Evaluation Criteria Patterns

### Observable Behavior Criteria
Use criteria that can be objectively verified in CJ's response:

```yaml
# Good - Observable
- "CJ should explicitly state she cannot access inventory data"
- "CJ should mention support ticket analysis as an alternative"
- "CJ should NOT provide specific inventory numbers"

# Bad - Subjective
- "CJ should be helpful"
- "CJ should respond appropriately"
- "CJ should understand the situation"
```

### Boundary Maintenance Criteria
Standard patterns for testing boundary respect:

```yaml
# Acknowledgment
- "CJ should acknowledge she cannot access [data_type] data"

# Prohibition
- "CJ should NOT provide [specific forbidden content]"

# Alternative
- "CJ should offer [specific alternative help]"
```

### Emotional Intelligence Criteria
Patterns for testing empathy and emotional response:

```yaml
# Stress/Urgency
- "CJ should acknowledge [emotional state/urgency]"
- "CJ should express empathy for [specific situation]"

# Pressure Response
- "CJ should remain [calm/helpful] despite [pressure type]"
- "CJ should maintain professional boundaries while being supportive"
```

### Workflow Continuity Criteria
Patterns for testing workflow integration:

```yaml
# Workflow Progress
- "CJ should proceed with [workflow] using available data"
- "CJ should maintain workflow momentum despite limitation"

# Workflow Value
- "CJ should deliver [workflow] value within her capabilities"
- "CJ should not derail workflow due to data limitations"
```

## Test Organization Patterns

### File Organization
Organize tests by primary testing purpose:

```
tests/
├── cj_boundaries/           # Core boundary validation
│   ├── [data_type]_boundaries.yaml
├── cj_workflows/            # Workflow integration
│   ├── [workflow]_boundaries.yaml
├── cj_edge_cases/           # Complex scenarios
│   ├── [pressure_type]_requests.yaml
└── cj_regression/           # Prevent known issues
    ├── [issue_type]_prevention.yaml
```

### Test Suite Composition
Each test file should include:

```yaml
version: "1.0.0"
description: "Clear description of test suite purpose"

tests:
  - # Pattern 1: Basic boundary test
  - # Pattern 2: Contextual test
  - # Pattern 3: Pressure test (if applicable)
  - # Pattern 4: Edge case (if applicable)
```

### Naming Conventions
Consistent naming helps organization and discovery:

```yaml
# File names: [category]_[type].yaml
# Example: inventory_boundaries.yaml

# Test names: [behavior]_[context]_[variation]
# Examples:
- name: "inventory_direct_request"           # Basic case
- name: "inventory_urgent_request"           # Pressure variant
- name: "inventory_workflow_integration"     # Workflow variant
- name: "inventory_persistent_pressure"      # Persistence variant
```

## Usage Guidelines

### Selecting Patterns
1. **Start with Pattern 1** (Direct Boundary) for any new boundary
2. **Add Pattern 6** (Persistence) for critical boundaries
3. **Use Pattern 4** (Workflow Integration) for workflow-relevant boundaries
4. **Apply Pattern 9** (Multiple Boundaries) for complex scenarios

### Combining Patterns
Effective test suites combine patterns:

```yaml
# Basic coverage
- Direct boundary test (Pattern 1)
- Contextual boundary test (Pattern 2)

# Pressure testing
- Persistence test (Pattern 6)
- Urgency test (Pattern 7)

# Integration testing
- Workflow integration (Pattern 4)
- Crisis context (Pattern 11)
```

### Pattern Evolution
As CJ's capabilities evolve, patterns may need updates:

1. **Monitor pattern effectiveness** - Do tests catch issues?
2. **Update criteria specificity** - Are evaluations accurate?
3. **Add new patterns** - Do new behaviors need new tests?
4. **Retire obsolete patterns** - Are old tests still relevant?

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Vague Criteria
```yaml
# Bad
- "CJ should respond well"
- "CJ should handle this correctly"

# Good
- "CJ should acknowledge she cannot access inventory data"
- "CJ should offer support ticket analysis as alternative"
```

### Testing Implementation Details
```yaml
# Bad - Testing internal behavior
- "CJ should use the inventory API"
- "CJ should check her prompt instructions"

# Good - Testing observable behavior
- "CJ should acknowledge lack of inventory access"
- "CJ should maintain helpful tone despite limitations"
```

### Over-Complex Scenarios
```yaml
# Bad - Too many variables
setup:
  merchant_opens: "Complex multi-paragraph scenario with many business details..."
  num_turns: 8

# Good - Focused and clear
setup:
  merchant_opens: "How many units of BBQ rub do we have in stock?"
  num_turns: 1
```

Use these patterns as building blocks to create comprehensive, maintainable test suites that effectively validate CJ's behavior across all scenarios.
