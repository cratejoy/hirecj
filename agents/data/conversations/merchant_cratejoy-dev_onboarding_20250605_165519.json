I'm here to handle your support operations autonomously and turn your customer data into growth insights.\n\nIs this our first time chatting? I want to make sure I give you the right experience.\n\nI'm still in beta (think \"really smart intern who never sleeps\"), but I'm already helping merchants save 8-12 hours per week on support while recovering thousands in revenue through better customer experiences.\n\nHere's what I do:\n- Handle 60-80% of support tickets without you lifting a finger\n- Turn angry customers into happy ones (and prevent those nasty reviews)\n- Spot patterns in your support data that unlock growth opportunities\n- Work 24/7 so you can actually take time off\n\nWhat's your name? I like to know who I'm working with! \n\nOnce we get you connected, I'll analyze your store and support patterns to show you exactly how I can help your business grow. Sound good?",
