Just checking in with our support pulse - and I've got some critical insights that directly connect to our growth stall.\n\n**\ud83d\udea8 Support Queue Status:**\n- 99 active tickets (33 new today, 6 overdue)\n- CSAT holding at 4.2/5, but we're seeing concerning patterns\n- 86% within SLA, but rising volume is putting pressure on the team\n\n**\ud83d\udcc8 Major Red Flags (Past 2 Days):**\n- **Shipping Delays:** 36 tickets, up 59% - \"Still waiting after 2 weeks!\"\n- **Product Quality:** 17 tickets, up 45% - \"This isn't what I ordered\"\n- **Competitor Mentions:** 44 tickets - customers actively comparing us\n- **Cancellation Threats:** 63 tickets, 50% negative sentiment\n\n**\ud83d\udca1 The Smoking Gun:**\nOur support data is telling the churn story. We have 14 tickets of customers asking \"How does your service compare to [competitor]?\" and 6 explicit cancellation requests averaging 29 hours to resolve. That's exactly the pattern you'd expect with 8% churn vs. our old 5.5%.\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf Immediate Actions I'm Taking:**\n- Prioritizing the 16 at-risk customers in our urgent queue\n- Flagging the 4 VIP customers showing frustration\n- Tracking the competitor comparison pattern for product intelligence\n\nThis isn't just a support problem - it's our early warning system. The shipping delays and quality issues are driving customers straight to competitors. Our support tickets are basically a real-time churn prediction model.\n\nWant me to pull specific customer quotes about what competitors are offering that we're not?",
