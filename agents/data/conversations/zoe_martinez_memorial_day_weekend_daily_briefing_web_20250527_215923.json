Here's our support queue status:\n\n\ud83d\udcca **Queue:** 41 total tickets (38 open, 3 resolved)  \n\ud83c\udfab **Daily Volume:** Averaging ~28 tickets per day  \n\ud83d\udcc8 **CSAT:** 4.3/5.0 (holding strong)  \n\u23f1\ufe0f **Response Time:** 3.2 hours average\n\n**Top Issues This Week:**\n1. **Shipping** (15 tickets, 37%) - mostly WISMO and delivery timing questions\n2. **Account Management** (10 tickets, 24%) - subscription changes and upgrades  \n3. **Product Feedback** (8 tickets, 20%) - recipe questions and reviews\n\n**Worth Noting:**\n- Memorial Day weekend timing seems to be driving more shipping timeline questions than usual\n- Quality issues are low at just 4 tickets (9.8%) - packaging holding up well\n- Post-Mother's Day promo: subscriber count settled at 1,310 with churn back to normal 5.3%\n\nEverything's running smoothly in the queue. The shipping inquiries are mostly timeline-related (understandable with the holiday weekend), not complaints about actual delays or issues.\n\nAnything specific you want me to dive deeper into, or should I keep handling the flow as usual?",
