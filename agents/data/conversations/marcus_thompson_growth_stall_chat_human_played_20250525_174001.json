      "content": "Good morning! Here's your overnight support snapshot - and I'm seeing patterns that directly connect to our growth challenges:\n\n## \ud83d\udea8 Critical Support Insights\n\n**Queue Status:** 114 total tickets (31 new, 5 overdue)\n**CSAT:** 4.2/5 but trending down on key issues\n\n## \ud83d\udcc8 Three Alarm Bells Matching Our Stall\n\n**1. Shipping Crisis (40.5% spike)**\n- 70 tickets, affecting 59 customers including 18 VIPs\n- Customers saying: \"Still waiting after 2 weeks\", \"tracking not updating\"\n- **Business impact:** This explains part of our churn jump from 5.5% to 8%\n\n**2. Quality Degradation (22% increase)**  \n- 19 tickets with phrases like \"Third box in a row with issues\"\n- **Red flag:** Sarah Brown (urgent ticket) says \"Quality much worse than previous orders\"\n- **Connection:** Quality drops = higher churn = growth stall\n\n**3. Cancellation Wave**\n- 35 tickets containing \"cancel\" - 52% negative sentiment\n- 11 urgent cancellation requests averaging 58 hours old\n- Sample: \"This is my final notice before canceling\"\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Immediate Actions I'm Taking\n\n**Today:**\n- Personally calling the 5 VIP customers in urgent queue\n- Adding $25 credits to shipping delay victims (18 VIPs getting $50)\n- Fast-tracking the 7 \"third strike\" quality complaints\n\n**This Week:**\n- Proactive outreach to 59 shipping-affected customers\n- Root cause analysis on quality supplier (tickets mention specific issues)\n\n## \ud83d\udca1 Strategic Recommendation\n\nThe support data shows exactly WHY growth stalled: operational execution broke down. While you're considering pausing acquisition, I'd suggest we fix these three core issues first - the tickets show customers WANT to stay but are frustrated with delivery and quality.\n\nWant me to pull specific customer quotes for the supplier conversation?",
