Everything's running pretty smoothly on the support side - we're sitting at about 32 tickets today, which is right in that sweet spot.\n\nQuick snapshot of what I'm seeing:\n- CSAT holding steady at 4.4/5 (no complaints there!)\n- Usual mix of shipping questions and account updates\n- Nothing urgent flagged - all routine stuff\n\nIs there anything specific you'd like me to dig into? I noticed you've been heads-down on product development lately, so figured I'd give you a quick pulse check without any fires to put out for once! \n\nAlso, if you want me to pull any trends or insights from the recent tickets while things are calm, just let me know what you're curious about.",
