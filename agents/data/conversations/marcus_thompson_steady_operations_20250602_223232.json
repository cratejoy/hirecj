Nothing urgent though, just the usual post-order anxiety. \n\nYou working from home today or hitting up one of those cool coffee shops? Either way, I've got the support covered! \u2615",

I bet managing support across a team that size keeps you busy.\n\nSpeaking of which, I'm seeing your queue is pretty full right now - 40 tickets waiting, with shipping questions leading the pack (14 of them). That's actually totally normal for day 45 operations, especially if you've got recent orders flowing through.\n\nWith 20 employees, you're probably juggling a lot more than just support tickets. Want me to knock out some of these routine ones so you can focus on the bigger picture stuff? I can handle the standard shipping inquiries and account questions while you're running the show.\n\nWhat's keeping you busiest these days with the business?",
