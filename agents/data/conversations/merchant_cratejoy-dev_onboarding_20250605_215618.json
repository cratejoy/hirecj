I'm here to handle your support operations autonomously so you can focus on growing your business.\n\nIs this our first time chatting? I want to make sure I give you the right experience - whether that's getting you set up from scratch or jumping right back into helping with your support operations.\n\nI should mention upfront - I'm still in beta, so you're getting early access to what I can do. The core functionality is solid (I already handle 60-80% of tickets for merchants like you), but we're constantly improving based on feedback from founders like yourself.\n\nWhat's your name, by the way? I like to know who I'm working with! \n\nOnce I know a bit about your setup, I can show you exactly how I'll save you hours every week while turning your support headaches into growth opportunities. No fluff - just real results you can measure.",
