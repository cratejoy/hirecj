Just saw your message - what would you like me to look into?\n\nIn the meantime, here's what's happening on the support front: We've got 33 tickets in today's queue with an average response time of 3.2 hours. Our CSAT is holding steady at 4.4, which is solid. \n\nThe main categories I'm seeing are shipping inquiries, account management requests, and product feedback. Nothing urgent escalated right now, but I'm keeping an eye on patterns.\n\nIs there something specific you want me to dive into, or would you like a deeper breakdown on any particular area?",
