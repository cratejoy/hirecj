Think of me as that tireless teammate who handles your support queue 24/7, turns angry customers into fans, and gives you back your evenings.\n\nI'm built to autonomously resolve 60-80% of your support tickets while turning all that support data into actual growth insights. No more drowning in customer complaints or losing sleep over weekend escalations.\n\nIs this our first time chatting? I want to make sure I give you the right experience - whether that's a quick tour of what I can do, or jumping right back into helping with your support operations.\n\nFair warning: I'm still in beta, so think of this as getting early access to your future support superhero. Ready to see what I can do with your store data?",
