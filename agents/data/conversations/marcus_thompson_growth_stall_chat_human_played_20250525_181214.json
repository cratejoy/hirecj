Just saw your message - I've been monitoring the queue and have some critical insights from our support data that directly connect to our growth stall.\n\n**\ud83d\udea8 Support Queue Status (Right Now):**\n- 42 new tickets, 8 overdue (81% within SLA)\n- CSAT holding at 4.2/5, but we have concerning patterns\n\n**\ud83d\udcc8 Three Major Red Flags:**\n\n1. **Shipping Delays Exploding** (\ud83d\udcc8 +76%)\n   - 31 tickets today alone with \"still waiting after 2 weeks!\"\n   - 59% negative sentiment - customers are REALLY frustrated\n   - This connects to the fulfillment issues you mentioned\n\n2. **Competitor Pressure** (7 tickets in 72 hours)\n   - Customers directly asking \"How does your service compare to [competitor]?\"\n   - These align perfectly with that loyalty program launch undercutting us by 20%\n\n3. **Churn Warning Signals** (11 active cancellation requests)\n   - \"This is my final notice before canceling\"\n   - 14 at-risk customers in queue\n   - Multiple contacts without resolution (45% of escalations)\n\n**\ud83d\udca1 The Support Data Story:**\nOur ticket patterns are telling the exact story of our growth stall - customers frustrated by shipping (which costs us 15% more now), comparing us to competitors, and threatening to leave. We're not just seeing growth stall; we're seeing why in real customer voices.\n\n**Immediate Actions I'm Taking:**\n- Personally handling all 11 cancellation threats\n- Flagging VIP customers with quality complaints\n- Tracking competitor mention patterns for intel\n\nWant me to pull specific customer quotes or dive deeper into any pattern?",
