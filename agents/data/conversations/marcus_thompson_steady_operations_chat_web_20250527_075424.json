Our CSAT is holding strong at 4.4/5, and we're maintaining our 3.2-hour average response time.\n\nHere's what I'm seeing pattern-wise today:\n\n**Shipping continues to dominate** - 14 tickets (35% of queue), mostly the usual \"where's my order\" and delay questions. Nothing alarming, just our standard WISMO flow.\n\n**Account management is active** - 10 tickets (25%) with subscription upgrades and payment updates. Actually a good sign - means customers are engaging more with the platform.\n\n**Product feedback is solid** - 8 tickets (20%) with reviews and recipe questions. Customers are clearly using and engaging with the products.\n\nThe smaller categories are quality issues and billing at 4 tickets each - all within normal ranges.\n\nOverall, it's looking like a typical steady operations day. Queue is manageable, customer satisfaction is strong, and no red flags popping up. Ready to dive into anything specific you want me to look at!",
