Looking at our support queue, we're handling 41 tickets total with 38 still open - mostly staying on top of the flow with our 3.2-hour average response time.\n\nHere's what I'm seeing pattern-wise:\n\n**Top Issues Today:**\n\u2022 **Shipping** (15 tickets, 37%) - Lots of \"where is my order\" and delay questions\n\u2022 **Account Management** (10 tickets, 24%) - Subscription upgrades and payment updates\n\u2022 **Product Feedback** (8 tickets, 20%) - Recipe questions and product reviews\n\nOur CSAT is holding steady at 4.3/5, which is solid. The shipping category is definitely our biggest volume driver at about 11 tickets per day - pretty typical for this time of year with Memorial Day weekend approaching.\n\nAnything specific you want me to dive deeper into? I can pull detailed data on any of these categories or flag any customers that might need special attention.",
