I've been monitoring our support queue overnight and we've got some critical patterns emerging that directly connect to the growth stall.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 **URGENT SUPPORT INTEL**\n\n**Queue Status:** 43 new tickets today, but here's what's really concerning - we're seeing a perfect storm of retention threats:\n\n**\ud83d\udcc8 Competitor Mentions Spike:** \n- 23 tickets in past 7 days mentioning competitors (\u2191 340% from last week)\n- 18 specifically mention our main competitor's new loyalty program\n- Customer quote: *\"Their loyalty program gives 15% back on every order\"*\n- 9 customers already threatening cancellation over this\n\n**\ud83d\ude9b Shipping Crisis Accelerating:**\n- 19 shipping delay tickets today alone (\u2191 70.9% spike)\n- Customer quote: *\"Still waiting after 2 weeks!\"*\n- West Coast hit hardest (likely our fulfillment center issues you mentioned)\n\n**\ud83d\udc94 Cancellation Requests Critical:**\n- 17 active cancellation requests \n- Only 23% retention rate (we're losing 77% of these customers)\n- Top reasons: shipping delays (47%), competitor pricing (35%), quality issues (18%)\n\n**The Voice of Our Customers:**\n- *\"Your competitor just launched a loyalty program and is 20% cheaper\"*\n- *\"This is the third delayed shipment this month\"* \n- *\"Customer service takes forever to respond\"*\n\n**What I'm seeing:** These aren't isolated issues - they're creating a compound effect. Shipping delays are pushing customers to research competitors, where they're finding better pricing AND a loyalty program we don't have.\n\nOur customers are literally telling us why they're considering leaving. The support data shows exactly what's driving the churn spike from 5.5% to 8%.\n\nWant me to pull specific customer examples or dig deeper into any of these patterns?",
