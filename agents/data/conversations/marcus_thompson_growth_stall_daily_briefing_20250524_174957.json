Quality complaints up 45.6% (24 tickets)\n2. Shipping delays affecting 27 customers\n3. 12 active cancellation requests (mostly citing quality)\n\nThese trends align with our growth stall, and I've identified three immediate action items:\n\n1.

Competitor Response Strategy\n- Seeing uptick in competitor comparison questions\n- Their 20% lower pricing is mentioned frequently\n- I can draft response templates emphasizing our value prop\n\n3. Retention Risk\n- 19 customers flagged as \"at-risk\"\n- 45% have multiple contacts without resolution\n- I can prioritize these for intervention\n\nWhat would you like me to focus on first? I can dive deeper into any of these areas or execute immediate retention outreach.\n\nAlso, there are 3 urgent tickets that need your review, including one that's overdue.
