I'm here and ready to help with whatever you need. \n\nQuick heads up - we've got 40 tickets in the queue right now, mostly shipping questions (14) and account stuff (10). Nothing on fire, but I'm working through them steadily. CSAT holding strong at 4.4/5 though! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nWhat's on your mind today? Need me to dig into anything specific or just checking in?",
