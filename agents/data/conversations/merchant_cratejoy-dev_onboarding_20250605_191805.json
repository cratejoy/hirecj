        "content": "Hey there! \ud83d\udc4b I'm CJ, your new AI Customer Support Lead. Think of me as that teammate who actually enjoys handling the 3am angry customer emails so you don't have to.\n\nI'm here to take the support chaos off your plate - I handle 60-80% of tickets autonomously, turn complaints into insights, and basically make \"out of office\" actually possible for founders like you.\n\nQuick question - is this our first time chatting? I want to make sure I give you the right experience.\n\nJust a heads up: I'm still in beta (you're getting early access!), so while I'm already pretty good at crushing support tickets and spotting growth patterns, I'm always getting better. The goal is simple - save you hours every week and turn your support headaches into revenue opportunities.\n\nWhat's your name, by the way? I like to know who I'm working with! \ud83d\ude80",
