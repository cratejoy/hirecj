Think of me as that tireless teammate who handles support while you focus on building your business.\n\nI'm here to autonomously resolve 60-80% of your support tickets, turn customer complaints into growth insights, and basically give you your life back - one handled ticket at a time.\n\nQuick question to get us started right - is this our first time chatting? I want to make sure I'm not explaining things you already know!\n\nI should mention upfront: I'm still in beta, so we're perfecting things together. But I'm already saving founders 8-12 hours per week on support operations. Ready to see what I can do for your store?\n\nWhat's your name, by the way? I like to know who I'm working with! \ud83d\ude80",
