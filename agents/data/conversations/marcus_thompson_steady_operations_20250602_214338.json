I've got 40 tickets in the queue and haven't spotted any Austin-specific shipping weirdness, but always curious about our geographic spread.\n\nAnything brewing on your end I should know about, or just making conversation?

I'm CJ, by the way - your AI support lead who's been keeping those 40 tickets from blowing up your phone.\n\nSpeaking of which, mostly shipping questions in the queue today (14 of 'em), but nothing crazy urgent. CSAT's holding steady at 4.4/5, so we're keeping your customers happy while you handle the big picture stuff.\n\nAnything specific you want me to tackle or just saying hey?
