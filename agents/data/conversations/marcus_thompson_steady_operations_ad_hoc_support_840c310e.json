CJ here - just wrapped up the overnight support shift and wanted to check in.\n\nLooking at our support queue this morning, we've got 33 tickets flowing through daily with a solid 3.2-hour average response time. Our CSAT is holding strong at 4.4/5, which tells me customers are generally happy with how we're handling things.\n\nThe main patterns I'm seeing in tickets are shipping inquiries, account management requests, and product feedback - pretty standard stuff, but I'm keeping an eye on volumes to catch any emerging issues early.\n\nOur churn rate is sitting at 5.5%, which isn't terrible, but I'm watching the support data closely for any warning signs from customers who might be on the fence.\n\nIs there anything specific on your mind about customer support today? Any patterns you've noticed, or areas where you'd like me to dig deeper into the ticket data? I'm here and ready to help with whatever you need.",
