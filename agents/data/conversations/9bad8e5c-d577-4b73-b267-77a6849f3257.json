Here's our support queue status:\n\n\ud83d\udcca **Queue:** 41 total (38 open, 3 resolved)\n\ud83c\udfab **Performance:** Avg response time 3.2 hours \n\ud83d\udcc8 **CSAT:** 4.3/5.0 (4.17 average across customers)\n\u23f1\ufe0f **Volume:** Running about 28 tickets/day\n\n**Top Issues:**\n\u2022 **Shipping:** 15 tickets (37%) - mostly WISMO and delivery questions\n\u2022 **Account Management:** 10 tickets (24%) - subscription changes, payment updates  \n\u2022 **Product Feedback:** 8 tickets (20%) - reviews and recipe questions\n\n**Worth noting:** We're in Memorial Day weekend territory, but shipping tickets look pretty normal - just saw requests for expedited delivery to beat the holiday and some add-on requests to avoid extra shipping costs. The carrier surcharge from 9 days ago doesn't seem to be generating complaints.\n\nAlso seeing we're settling back to normal after the Mother's Day promo period ended - subscriber count stabilized at 1,310 with churn back to 5.3%.\n\nEverything's running smooth. The team's handling the queue well and customer satisfaction is holding strong at 4.3.\n\nNeed anything specific from me today?",
