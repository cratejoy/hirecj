Just pulled our latest support data - we've got some critical insights that directly connect to our growth stall.\n\n**\ud83d\udea8 Support Queue Status:**\n- 107 tickets in queue (44 new, 42 open, 10 pending)\n- 3 overdue tickets, 11 cancellation requests pending\n- CSAT holding at 4.2/5 overall, but shipping satisfaction down to 3.9/5\n\n**\ud83d\udcc8 Trending Issues (Past Week):**\n- **Shipping delays:** 33 tickets (+41.6%) - \"Still waiting after 2 weeks!\"\n- **Billing problems:** 20 tickets (+30.2%) - \"Why was I charged twice?\"\n- **Quality complaints:** 29 tickets (stable but concerning)\n\n**\u26a0\ufe0f Growth Stall Red Flags:**\n- **11 active cancellation requests** in queue averaging 50 hours old\n- **6 competitor comparison questions** - customers actively shopping around\n- **16 VIP customers** affected by shipping issues\n- **25 at-risk customers** flagged in urgent queue\n\n**Customer Voice Patterns:**\n\"How does your service compare to [competitor]?\" (6 tickets)\n\"This is my final notice before canceling\" (11 tickets)\n\"Third box in a row with issues\" (quality complaints)\n\nThis data suggests our fulfillment issues and the 15% shipping cost increase are creating a perfect storm - customers are frustrated, comparing alternatives, and churning. The 41.6% spike in shipping complaints directly correlates with your churn jump from 5.5% to 8%.\n\nWant me to prioritize reaching out to those 11 cancellation-threatening customers? I can also analyze which specific fulfillment patterns are driving the complaints.",

When customers ask \"where's my order?\" we need fulfillment data we don't have immediate access to.\n\nWant me to implement expedited handling for shipping-related tickets? We could also set up auto-responses with tracking links to buy us resolution time.",
