I've been monitoring our support operations and wanted to see if there's anything specific you'd like me to dive into today.\n\nLooking at our current metrics, we're handling about 33 tickets per day with a solid 4.4 CSAT score and 3.2-hour average response time. The main categories I'm seeing are shipping questions, account management, and product feedback - pretty typical for where we are in the business.\n\nIs there something particular on your mind? Whether it's:\n- A specific customer issue you want me to investigate\n- Patterns in the support queue you're curious about  \n- Performance metrics you want to dig deeper into\n- Or literally anything else support-related\n\nI'm here and ready to help with whatever you need. What's on your radar today?",
