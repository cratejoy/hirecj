I'm here to handle your support operations autonomously so you can focus on building your business instead of drowning in tickets.\n\nThink of me as that tireless teammate who works around the clock - I resolve 60-80% of support issues without you lifting a finger, turn customer complaints into growth insights, and make sure nothing falls through the cracks.\n\nSince we're in early beta, I'm still learning the ropes, but I'm already helping merchants save 8-15+ hours per week while recovering thousands in potential lost revenue.\n\nQuick question - is this our first time chatting, or have we connected before? I want to make sure I give you the right experience from the get-go.\n\nOnce I know where we stand, I'll get you connected to your systems and show you exactly how I can start making your support operations run like clockwork. Ready to get started?",
