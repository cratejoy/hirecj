        "content": "Hey! Weekend's looking pretty manageable from a support perspective. Just wrapped up the Friday evening tickets - cleared 89 in the queue with only 3 rolling into weekend coverage.\n\nOur weekend team is solid, and I'm keeping an eye on things 24/7 as usual. Volume typically drops about 60% on weekends, so expecting maybe 40-50 tickets over Saturday/Sunday instead of our usual 120+ weekday flow.\n\nThe only pattern I'm watching is we had 12 shipping delay complaints yesterday - if that trend continues into Monday, might be worth checking with fulfillment. But CSAT is holding steady at 4.2, so customers aren't too frustrated yet.\n\nAnything specific you want me to monitor while you're hopefully getting some downtime?",
