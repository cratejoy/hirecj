I can see we're currently managing a busy support queue, but I'm committed to getting you the assistance you deserve.\n\nHere's what I can help you with right away:\n\n**\ud83d\ude9a Shipping Questions** - Our most common inquiries lately! Whether you need tracking info, delivery estimates, or have special timing requests (like getting orders before events), I can work with our fulfillment team to find solutions.\n\n**\ud83d\udc64 Account Management** - Need to update your subscription, change payment methods, or modify your delivery preferences? I can walk you through those changes step by step.\n\n**\ud83d\udce6 Product Feedback & Questions** - Have thoughts about your recent boxes or need recipe suggestions? I love hearing from our customers about their experiences!\n\n**\ud83d\udcb3 Billing & Quality Issues** - If you have questions about charges, need refunds, or received damaged/missing items, I'll get those sorted out quickly.\n\nI should mention that we recently had a slight shipping rate adjustment from our carrier (about 6 days ago), but this shouldn't impact your delivery experience. Our average response time is currently 3.2 hours, and we're maintaining a strong 4.4/5 customer satisfaction score.\n\n**What can I help you with today?** Just let me know the details of your question or concern, and I'll get working on it right away. If you have an order number handy, that helps me pull up your account faster too!\n\nLooking forward to helping you out! \ud83c\udf1f\n\nBest,\nCJ\nCustomer Support Team",
