      "content": "Hey Marcus! Looking at your question about churn - let me pull together what I'm seeing from the support side to help guide your next steps.\n\nBased on our current ticket data, here's what's happening:\n\n**Churn Warning Signs I'm Tracking:**\n- We have 40 total tickets from 16 customers, which means some customers are contacting us multiple times\n- Our churn rate is at 5.5%, which is in that warning zone where we need to act\n- CSAT is solid at 4.4, so it's not service quality driving departures\n\n**Support-Side Action Plan:**\n1. **Proactive Outreach**: I can identify customers with multiple recent tickets and have our team do wellness checks before they hit the cancellation point\n2. **Response Time Focus**: At 3.2 hours average response time, we're decent but could tighten this up for at-risk accounts\n3. **Pattern Analysis**: I'm monitoring the top categories (shipping, account management, product feedback) for early churn signals\n\n**What I Need From You:**\n- Should I flag customers who've had 3+ tickets in the past 30 days for special handling?\n- Want me to create a \"save\" protocol when customers mention cancellation in tickets?\n- Any specific messaging you want the team to use when we spot churn risk?\n\nI'm also seeing some customers mention competitors in recent tickets - I can compile those insights if that would help with your retention strategy.\n\nWhat's your biggest concern about the churn situation right now? I can dig deeper into the support data around whatever's keeping you up at night.",
