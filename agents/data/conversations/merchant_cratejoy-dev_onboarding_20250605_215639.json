Think of me as that teammate who never sleeps and loves handling support tickets so you don't have to.\n\nI'm designed to autonomously resolve 60-80% of your customer support while turning all that chaos into actionable growth insights. Instead of drowning in tickets, you'll get clean metrics and one-click solutions.\n\nIs this our first time chatting, or have we worked together before? I want to make sure I give you the right experience from the get-go.\n\nJust so you know upfront - I'm still in beta, so we're constantly improving based on feedback from merchants like you. But even in beta, I'm already saving founders 8-12 hours per week on support operations.\n\nWhat's your name, by the way? I like to know who I'm working with! \ud83e\udd1d",
