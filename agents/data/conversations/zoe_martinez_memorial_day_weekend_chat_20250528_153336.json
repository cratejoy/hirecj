Despite the higher volume, we're maintaining a strong customer satisfaction score of 4.3/5.\n\n**What We're Seeing:**\n1. **Shipping inquiries (36% of tickets)** - Many customers are asking about delivery timing, especially after the Memorial Day weekend period. Our carrier implemented holiday surcharges, but our ops team absorbed those costs to protect your customers.\n\n2. **Account management requests (24%)** - Lots of subscription upgrades and payment updates, which shows healthy customer engagement post-Mother's Day promo.\n\n3. **Product feedback (20%)** - Customers are actively sharing reviews and asking recipe questions, indicating strong product engagement.\n\n**Recent Highlights:**\n- The Mother's Day promo period just ended successfully\n- Net subscriber count is holding steady at 1,310\n- Churn rate is back to a healthy 5.3%\n\n**How We're Helping:**\n- Prioritizing shipping questions to set clear expectations\n- Streamlining account management requests for faster processing\n- Capturing valuable product feedback to share with your team\n\nIs there anything specific you'd like me to focus on or any particular customer concerns you'd like me to address? I'm here to make sure your customers have the best possible experience! \ud83c\udf1f\n\nBest regards,\nCJ\nCustomer Support Team",
