Good to see you! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nJust wrapped up the morning queue review - here's where we stand:\n\n**Current Support Status:**\n\u2022 40 tickets in queue, all being processed\n\u2022 Maintaining our 3.2-hour average response time\n\u2022 CSAT holding steady at 4.4/5 - customers are happy with our service\n\n**What I'm Seeing Today:**\n\u2022 **Shipping inquiries** leading the pack (14 tickets) - mostly WISMO questions and delivery timing\n\u2022 **Account management** requests up (10 tickets) - lots of subscription upgrades, which is actually great news\n\u2022 **Product feedback** flowing in (8 tickets) - customers sharing recipe ideas and reviews\n\nThe team's hitting our targets, and nothing's escalated to urgent status. Quality issues are minimal (just 4 tickets), so our product standards are holding strong.\n\nAnything specific you want me to dig into, or shall I keep you posted on any patterns that emerge throughout the day?",
