Here's what I'm seeing in our support operations right now:\n\n**\ud83d\udea8 Immediate Concerns**\n- **10 overdue tickets** need attention - we're at 76% SLA compliance \n- **14 cancellation requests** averaging 22 hours old (connecting to our churn increase)\n- **Competitor comparison questions** coming in - customers are shopping around\n\n**\ud83d\udcc8 Trending Issues (Past Week)**\n- **Shipping delays up 21%** - 91 total tickets, affecting 77 customers including 17 VIPs\n- **Quality complaints up 10.5%** - seeing \"This isn't what I ordered\" repeatedly  \n- Sample customer quote: *\"Still waiting after 2 weeks!\"*\n\n**\ud83d\udca1 Critical Pattern I'm Seeing**\nThe support data is showing exactly what's driving our growth stall:\n- Fulfillment issues creating customer frustration\n- Quality problems leading to repeat contacts (13 customers contacted multiple times about shipping)\n- Customers actively comparing us to competitors in tickets\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf Immediate Actions I'm Taking**\n- Prioritizing those 14 cancellation requests for personal outreach\n- Flagging the 17 VIP customers with shipping issues for retention calls\n- Processing quality complaint escalations within 4 hours\n\n**\ud83d\udcca Queue Status:** 45 new tickets today, solved 31, maintaining 4.2/5 CSAT despite the issues\n\nThe support data is painting a clear picture of why growth stalled - we need to fix the fulfillment experience before customers defect to competitors. Want me to pull specific customer quotes about what they're saying about the competition?",

When those tickets sit too long, they escalate. Now we're handling both the original issue AND the frustrated follow-ups.\n\n**\ud83d\udca1 Immediate Fix**\nI'm prioritizing those 8 cancellation requests for personal outreach today - most are VIP customers we can't afford to lose. The shipping delays are creating a customer experience crisis that's directly feeding our support backlog.\n\nThe real fix isn't more support capacity - it's fixing whatever's broken in our fulfillment chain that's causing these 2-week delays.",
