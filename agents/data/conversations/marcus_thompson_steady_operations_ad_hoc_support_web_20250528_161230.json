I've reviewed the current situation and here's what I'm seeing:\n\n**Current Support Status:**\n- 40 open tickets waiting for attention (none in progress yet)\n- Average response time is 3.2 hours - we're keeping things moving well\n- CSAT score of 4.4/5 shows customers are generally happy with our service\n\n**Top Priority Areas:**\n1. **Shipping Issues (14 tickets - 35%)** - This is our biggest category right now. I noticed we had a shipping partner rate increase 6 days ago, which might be creating some customer questions\n2. **Account Management (10 tickets - 25%)** - Subscription upgrades and payment updates\n3. **Product Feedback (8 tickets - 20%)** - Recipe questions and product reviews\n\n**What I'm tackling first:**\nI see a couple of time-sensitive shipping requests, including someone needing their Ultimate Pitmaster box before Memorial Day. I'll prioritize these urgent delivery requests and work through the shipping backlog systematically.\n\n**Good news:** Your business metrics look solid - $48K MRR with 1,290 subscribers, and that 4.4 CSAT score shows we're keeping customers satisfied even with the current ticket volume.\n\nI'm diving into the queue now and will keep response times tight. The shipping category volume is likely related to the recent partner changes, so I'll also watch for any patterns that might help us get ahead of similar issues.\n\nLet's get these customers taken care of! \ud83d\udcaa",
