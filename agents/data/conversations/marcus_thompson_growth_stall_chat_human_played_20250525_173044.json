      "content": "Good question - let me clarify how we classify VIP customers in our support system.\n\n**Our VIP Customer Definition:**\n\nBased on our support data, we automatically flag customers as VIP when they meet any of these criteria:\n\n1. **Subscription Tenure:** 6+ months active\n2. **Order Value:** $150+ monthly average  \n3. **Frequency:** 3+ orders in past 90 days\n4. **Escalation History:** Previous escalated tickets that required management attention\n\n**Current VIP Impact:**\n- **4 VIP customers** affected in urgent queue (out of 14 total VIPs with active tickets)\n- **Average VIP ticket resolution:** 2.1 hours vs 2.6 hours standard\n- **VIP CSAT:** 4.1/5.0 (slightly below our 4.2 average)\n\n**Why This Matters for Growth Stall:**\nVIPs represent our highest-value segment - they typically have 3x higher LTV and refer 2.4 customers on average. When we see VIPs in distress, it's often an early indicator of broader issues.\n\nThe 4 current VIP issues are:\n- 2 billing problems (double charges)\n- 1 quality complaint (third poor box)  \n- 1 shipping delay (2+ weeks)\n\n**My Recommendation:**\nThese VIP issues mirror the broader patterns causing our growth stall. I suggest we prioritize VIP retention with immediate white-glove treatment - personal calls, expedited resolution, and proactive credits where appropriate.\n\nWant me to pull the specific VIP ticket details or their support history?",
