        "content": "Hey! Weekend's been pretty smooth on the support front. We've handled 23 tickets since Friday evening - mostly routine stuff like order status questions and a few return requests. Response times are solid at 1.2 hours average, well within our weekend SLA.\n\nHad one minor spike yesterday around 2pm with 6 WISMO tickets all hitting at once (probably people checking on their Friday orders), but the team knocked those out quickly. CSAT is holding steady at 4.4 - customers seem happy with our weekend coverage.\n\nOnly thing worth flagging: 3 customers mentioned they're having trouble with the password reset flow on mobile. Not urgent, but might be worth a quick check on Monday if you're doing any site maintenance.\n\nQueue's looking clean heading into Sunday - just 4 tickets pending and nothing time-sensitive. The team's got it covered if you want to actually enjoy your weekend! \n\nAnything specific you want me to keep an eye on?",
