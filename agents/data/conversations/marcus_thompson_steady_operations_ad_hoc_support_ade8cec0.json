I don't have the full context of that specific ticket in my immediate view, but I'm here to help you dig into whatever you need.\n\nCould you give me a bit more detail about zebra_167c321d? Is this a specific customer issue, a ticket ID, or something else you've been working on? Once I understand what we're dealing with, I can pull the relevant support data and give you those actionable recommendations.\n\nLooking at our current support metrics while we're talking - we're handling things pretty well overall with a 4.4 CSAT score, but I'm always ready to dive into specific issues that need attention. What's the situation you're facing?",
