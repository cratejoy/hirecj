      "content": "Based on our support data, I understand your concern about the growth stall, and I can share some important customer insights that might help inform your next steps.\n\nFrom our support tickets and customer interactions, we're seeing three main challenges:\n\n1. Quality Issues: Our support data shows 29 recent quality-related concerns, specifically around batch #4521. This is likely contributing to our CSAT score of 4.2/5.0, which is below our usual standards.\n\n2. Shipping Delays: We're seeing an uptick in \"where is my order\" tickets, with 11 recent cancellations specifically citing shipping delays. This aligns with your observation about increased shipping costs.\n\n3. Customer Retention Risk: We've identified 180 at-risk customers with low engagement scores (3.8/10), representing significant MRR that we could protect with targeted intervention.\n\nWhile pausing paid acquisition might help control costs, our support data suggests focusing on retention could be more impactful. Here's what we're seeing success with:\n\n- Our retention emails with targeted offers are showing positive response rates\n- Customers who receive dedicated support attention are showing higher engagement\n- Quality issue resolution is key to rebuilding trust\n\nFrom a customer support perspective, I'd recommend:\n1. Immediately addressing the quality issues in batch #4521\n2. Implementing proactive shipping delay communications\n3. Launching a dedicated support channel for our at-risk customers\n\nWould you like me to help implement any of these support-focused solutions while you evaluate the broader strategy? I can start by drafting proactive communications or setting up the dedicated support channel for at-risk customers.",
