      "content": "Hi Marcus,\n\nI'm initiating our crisis response workflow based on the current support situation. Here's what I'm seeing:\n\n**CRISIS SUMMARY:**\nWe're experiencing a shipping crisis with 14 shipping-related tickets (35% of our total queue) and several critical issues that need immediate attention.\n\n**KEY ISSUES IDENTIFIED:**\n1. **Missing/Lost Packages:** Multiple customers reporting packages marked as \"delivered\" but never received (tickets #tkt_0004, #tkt_0006)\n2. **Time-Sensitive Orders:** Urgent Memorial Day requests that could impact customer satisfaction if not handled quickly (tickets #tkt_0002, #tkt_0005)\n3. **Shipping Partner Impact:** The 3% rate increase from our primary shipping partner (announced Day 39) may be affecting service quality\n\n**IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN:**\n1. **Escalate Missing Package Cases:** Contact FedEx/UPS immediately to initiate traces for orders #CG-51261 and #BSK-78901\n2. **Memorial Day Priority Queue:** Fast-track all Memorial Day-related orders to ensure delivery by 5/25-5/27\n3. **Proactive Communication:** Send status updates to affected customers within 2 hours\n4. **Shipping Partner Review:** Schedule emergency call with shipping partner to address service quality concerns\n\n**CURRENT IMPACT:**\n- 40 open tickets with 0 resolved (unusual for our typical workflow)\n- CSAT holding at 4.4/5 but at risk if shipping issues persist\n- Multiple negative sentiment tickets related to shipping\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n- Consider backup shipping options for urgent orders\n- Implement package signature requirements for high-value items\n- Review shipping partner SLA and consider diversifying carriers\n\nI'm prioritizing the missing package investigations and Memorial Day orders. Would you like me to draft customer communication templates for the affected orders?\n\nLet me know if you need me to escalate anything further or if you want to discuss contingency shipping options.\n\n-CJ",
