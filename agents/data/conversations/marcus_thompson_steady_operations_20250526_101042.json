Queue's sitting at a comfortable 32 tickets, mostly the usual mix of shipping questions and account updates. Nothing dramatic happening, which is exactly what we want on a Tuesday.\n\nQuick overnight snapshot:\n- 8 tickets handled while you were sleeping\n- Saved about 1.2 hours of manual work\n- CSAT holding steady at our 4.4 baseline\n\nCouple things on my radar:\n- Noticed 3 customers asking about summer-themed boxes - might be worth noting for upcoming curation\n- One shipping delay with USPS that I'm monitoring (customer's already updated and happy)\n\nEverything's running smooth! Need me to dig into anything specific today, or should I just keep the queue flowing?",
