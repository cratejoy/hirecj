Shipping inquiries\n2. Account management requests  \n3. Product feedback\n\nWith 1,290 subscribers and $48K MRR, our support load is proportional - about 2.5 tickets per 100 customers daily, which shows we're maintaining good service quality.\n\nIs there anything specific about our support operations you'd like me to dive into?
