We've handled 33 tickets per day on average with a 3.2-hour response time, and our CSAT is holding strong at 4.4/5. The main categories we're seeing are shipping inquiries, account management requests, and product feedback.\n\nHere's what I want to walk through with you today:\n\n**\ud83d\udcca Performance Highlights**\n- Our 16 customers generated 40 total tickets this period\n- Support team is maintaining quality with that 4.4 CSAT score\n- Response times averaging 3.2 hours - room for improvement here\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf Key Patterns I'm Seeing**\nFrom the ticket data, shipping remains our top category, followed by account management and product feedback. This gives us some clear areas to focus on.\n\n**\ud83d\udca1 Strategic Questions for Us**\n- How do you feel about our current response time performance? \n- Any concerns about the shipping inquiries trend?\n- What's your take on the product feedback we're collecting?\n\nI've got deeper insights on customer sentiment, operational efficiency, and some opportunities I'm seeing. Where would you like to start? Should we dive into the shipping ticket patterns first, or is there another area you're particularly focused on this week?\n\nWhat's on your mind from the business side that I should factor into our support strategy?",

Our CSAT is sitting at a solid 4.4/5, so customers are generally happy with how we're resolving their issues.\n\nThe main categories I'm seeing in tickets are shipping questions, account management requests, and product feedback - pretty typical mix for our business. Nothing major jumping out as urgent patterns right now.\n\nSince we're doing our weekly review, what areas would you like to dive deeper into? I can break down any of the support metrics, share specific customer feedback themes, or walk through how our resolution times are trending compared to last week.\n\nWhat's on your mind for support operations?",
