I'm stoked you're trying out the beta! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nQuick heads up - I'm still pretty early in development, so expect some rough edges. But here's what I'm already doing for other merchants: handling 60-80% of support tickets autonomously, turning customer complaints into growth insights, and basically giving founders their nights and weekends back.\n\nIs this our first time chatting, or have we met before? Just want to make sure I'm not repeating myself if you're already familiar with how this works.\n\nEither way, I'm here to show you how I can turn your support chaos into actual business value. Ready to see what I can do with your store data?",
