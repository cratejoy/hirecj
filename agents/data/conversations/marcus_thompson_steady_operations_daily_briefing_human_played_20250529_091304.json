Pretty standard pattern for us.\n\nEverything's running smoothly in the support operation. The team's handling the medium stress level well, and we're maintaining good customer satisfaction scores.\n\nAnything specific you want me to dive into today, or any particular customer situations I should keep an eye on?",
