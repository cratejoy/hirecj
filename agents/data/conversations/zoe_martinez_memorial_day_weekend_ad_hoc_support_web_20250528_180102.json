Currently showing 28 tickets for today with an average response time of 3.2 hours - we're staying well within our SLA targets.\n\nI'm seeing the usual mix coming through: shipping inquiries are leading the pack, followed by account management requests and some product feedback. Our CSAT is holding steady at 4.3, which shows our customers are happy with how we're handling their concerns.\n\nEverything's running smoothly on my end - no major escalations or unusual patterns to flag right now. The team's performing well and ticket flow is manageable.\n\nWhat can I help you with today? Whether it's diving into specific metrics, investigating a particular issue, or just wanting a deeper look at any trends I'm seeing - I'm here and ready to assist!",
