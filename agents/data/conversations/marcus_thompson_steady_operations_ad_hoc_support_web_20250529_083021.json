I've been monitoring our support operations around the clock and wanted to give you a quick snapshot of where we stand.\n\n**Current Support Status:**\n- 33 tickets handled per day on average\n- 3.2 hour average response time\n- 4.4 CSAT score (solid performance)\n- Top categories: shipping, account management, and product feedback\n\nLooking at our 40 total tickets across 16 customers, I'm seeing some interesting patterns that might be worth discussing. Our churn rate is at 5.5%, and several support interactions are giving me insights into what's driving customer concerns.\n\nWhat's on your mind today? Whether it's a specific customer issue, a pattern you've noticed, or just wanting to understand what I'm seeing in the support data - I'm here to help and can dive into any area you'd like to explore.\n\nIs there anything specific you'd like me to look into or help you with?",
