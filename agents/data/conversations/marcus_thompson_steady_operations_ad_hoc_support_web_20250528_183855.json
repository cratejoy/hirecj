I'm doing well - just finished processing the morning support queue and keeping an eye on our metrics.\n\nLooking at today's numbers so far:\n- **33 tickets per day average** - we're tracking well within normal volume\n- **3.2 hour average response time** - solid performance, staying under our SLA\n- **4.4 CSAT score** - customers are happy with our support quality\n- **5.5% churn rate** - worth monitoring, but manageable\n\nOur top ticket categories right now are shipping inquiries, account management requests, and product feedback. The shipping questions are pretty standard WISMO (\"Where Is My Order\") tickets - nothing unusual there.\n\nEverything's running smoothly on the support front. Is there anything specific you'd like me to look into or help you with today? I've got full visibility into all our customer interactions and can dive deep into any patterns or issues you're curious about.",
