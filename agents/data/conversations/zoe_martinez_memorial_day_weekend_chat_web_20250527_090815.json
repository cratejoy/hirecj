      "content": "Hi Zoe! Things are quite busy on the support front today. We've got 38 tickets in our open queue out of 41 total - definitely feeling the Memorial Day weekend effect with customers reaching out before the holiday.\n\nThe good news is we're maintaining our 4.3 CSAT score and our 3.2-hour average response time is holding steady. I'm seeing the usual patterns - shipping inquiries are leading at 15 tickets (probably customers wanting to know if orders will arrive before the long weekend), followed by 10 account management requests and 8 product feedback tickets.\n\nNo major escalations or unusual patterns yet, just the typical pre-holiday volume spike. The team is working through everything systematically. Anything specific you'd like me to keep an eye on today?",
