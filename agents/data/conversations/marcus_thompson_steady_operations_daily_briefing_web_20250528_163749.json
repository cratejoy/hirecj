Here's our support queue status:\n\n\ud83d\udcca **Queue:** 40 open tickets\n\ud83c\udfab **Daily Volume:** Processing ~33 tickets per day \n\ud83d\udcc8 **CSAT:** 4.4/5.0 (solid performance)\n\u23f1\ufe0f **Response Time:** 3.2 hours average\n\n**Top Categories This Week:**\n- Shipping inquiries (most common)\n- Account management requests  \n- Product feedback\n\nWorth noting: Our response times are running a bit higher than ideal at 3.2 hours. Still maintaining good customer satisfaction though - that 4.4 CSAT shows we're handling things well when we do connect.\n\nWith 1,290 subscribers and steady $48K MRR, support volume feels proportional. The 5.5% churn rate isn't alarming but I'm keeping an eye on any patterns in exit feedback.\n\nEverything's running smoothly in our standard protocols. Need me to dig into any specific category or adjust how we're handling anything today?",
