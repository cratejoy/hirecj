We've got 40 tickets in the queue that I'm working through - all currently open with none resolved yet today.\n\nHere's what I'm seeing:\n\n**Queue Breakdown:**\n- **Shipping issues** dominating at 14 tickets (35%) - lots of \"where is my order\" and delay questions\n- **Account management** at 10 tickets (25%) - subscription upgrades and payment updates\n- **Product feedback** at 8 tickets (20%) - recipe questions and reviews\n- **Quality issues** and **billing** each at 4 tickets (10%)\n\n**The Good News:**\n- Our CSAT is holding strong at 4.4/5 \n- Average response time is 3.2 hours, which is solid\n- No major escalations or crisis-level issues\n\n**What I'm Focused On:**\nThe shipping ticket volume suggests customers are anxious about deliveries - I'm prioritizing those WISMO (Where Is My Order) requests to keep satisfaction high. The account management tickets are mostly positive (upgrades!), so that's encouraging.\n\nAnything specific you want me to dig into or any patterns you're curious about?",
