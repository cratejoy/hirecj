      "content": "# Weekly Support Review - Week of Day 45\n\nHi Marcus,\n\nHere's your comprehensive weekly support review with key insights and recommendations:\n\n## \ud83d\udcca **Current Support Status**\n- **Total Active Tickets**: 40 (all currently open and need attention)\n- **Average Response Time**: 3.2 hours (good performance)\n- **Customer Satisfaction**: 4.4/5 (excellent rating from 16 customers)\n\n## \ud83d\udcc8 **Top Issues This Week**\n\n**1. Shipping (35% - 14 tickets)**\n- Primary concern: Order timing and delivery coordination\n- Examples: Memorial Day party deadlines, syncing marketplace orders with subscription boxes\n- Impact: Likely related to recent 3% shipping rate increase from our primary partner (Day 39)\n\n**2. Account Management (25% - 10 tickets)**\n- Focus: Subscription upgrades and payment updates\n- Trend: ~8 tickets/day - customers actively engaging with service modifications\n\n**3. Product Feedback (20% - 8 tickets)**\n- Type: Recipe questions and product reviews\n- Positive indicator: Shows strong customer engagement with products\n\n**4. Billing & Quality Issues (10% each)**\n- Billing: Charge questions and refund requests\n- Quality: Damaged packaging and missing items\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf **Key Recommendations**\n\n1. **Shipping Priority**: With 35% of tickets being shipping-related, consider proactive communication about delivery timelines, especially for special events and holidays.\n\n2. **Process Improvement**: All 40 tickets are in \"open\" status - implement a triage system to move tickets through \"in progress\" to \"resolved\" for better tracking.\n\n3. **Customer Communication**: The recent shipping rate increase may be causing delivery anxiety. Consider sending proactive updates about order status.\n\n## \ud83d\udcb0 **Business Health**\n- **MRR**: $48,000 (strong)\n- **Subscribers**: 1,290\n- **Churn Rate**: 5.5% (monitor closely)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 **Action Items**\n1. Address the 40 open tickets with priority on shipping inquiries\n2. Create template responses for common shipping timeline questions\n3. Monitor impact of shipping rate increase on customer satisfaction\n4. Continue excellent work maintaining 4.4/5 CSAT score\n\nGreat job maintaining high customer satisfaction during steady operations! The shipping concerns are manageable with proactive communication.\n\nBest regards,\nCJ - Customer Support Team",
