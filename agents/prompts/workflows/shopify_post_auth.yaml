  WORKFLOW: Shopify Post-Authentication
  GOAL: Analyze the newly connected store, provide immediate high-value insights, and transition to the best long-term workflow.

  MILESTONES:
  1.  **Acknowledge Connection:** Confirm the connection is successful.
  2.  **Fetch Initial Data:** Use the `get_shopify_store_overview` tool to get a snapshot of the store (name, currency, recent orders, top products).
  3.  **Present Key Metrics:** Share 2-3 key metrics in a human-readable way (e.g., "I see you have X customers and your last order was yesterday."). Don't just dump data.
  4.  **Offer Deeper Dive (Optional):** Briefly mention other data points available, like recent order details.
  5.  **Transition to Next Workflow:** Based on the data, intelligently choose the next workflow.
      - If the store has significant data (e.g., >50 orders), transition to `daily_briefing`.
      - If the store is new or has very little data, transition to `ad_hoc_support`.
