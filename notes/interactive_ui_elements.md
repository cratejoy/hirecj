Interactive UI Elements in LLM-Driven Chatbots (Recent Patterns and Best Practices)
Large Language Model (LLM) chatbots are evolving beyond plain text exchanges. Modern agentic chatbots (LLM-powered bots that can take actions or use tools) increasingly embed interactive UI elements – buttons, selection menus, forms, etc. – directly into the conversation. Over the last 6–12 months, several open-source projects and demos have pioneered elegant solutions for incorporating such interactivity. This report surveys these implementation patterns and best practices for reliability, complexity management, and UI reactivity/state handling. We also note how these patterns can extend to Slack and similar platforms.
Why Interactive Elements?
Interactive controls make conversations more efficient and user-friendly. Instead of forcing the user to type a choice or number for a list of options, the bot can present actual buttons or dropdowns to click. This is especially helpful for multi-step prompts or on mobile devices. For example, rather than:

AI: "Which country? 1. Spain 2. Italy 3. Greece" User: "2"

a chatbot can display clickable options “Spain”, “Italy”, “Greece” as buttons. The user simply clicks one, which is fed back to the LLM as if they had typed it. This streamlines the flow and reduces user effort. Recent “ChatUI 3.0” experiments have demonstrated entire conversations enriched with such UI controls, yielding a hybrid chat/GUI experience.
Approaches to Implementing Interactive UI in Chatbots
1. LLM-Generated Markup (“Magic Strings”)
One approach is to have the LLM output special markup or tokens in its response that instruct the client UI to render an interactive element. In this pattern, the LLM’s text includes a custom syntax (a “magic string”) that the frontend recognizes and replaces with actual UI components (buttons, checkboxes, etc.).

Example – Custom Chat Markup: The “LLM Chatbots 3.0” demo by AI Rabbit (Oct 2024) uses a simple custom markup language in chat responses. The model is prompted to produce tags like [SINGLE_SELECT] or [MULTI_SELECT] followed by enumerated options. For instance:

[SINGLE_SELECT]  
1. {{fa-home}} Home  
2. {{fa-user}} Profile  
3. {{fa-cog}} Settings

Here [SINGLE_SELECT] denotes a single-choice button group, and {{fa-user}} is an icon indicator (FontAwesome icon for a user). The client parses this response into a structured format (e.g. a JSON or array of options) and then renders actual buttons with those labels and icons. When the user clicks one, the choice is sent back into the conversation (often injected as a user message like “Selected: Home”) so the LLM can continue consistently.

On the frontend side, developers implement a parser and renderer for this markup. A React-based UI might, for example, split the LLM’s message into plain text vs. option objects, then map over options to create <button> elements. In the AI Rabbit demo, the chat client distinguishes string content from an array of {text, options, type} items; if message.content is an array with an options field, it calls a renderOptions() function to output the appropriate <button> or checkbox inputs depending on the type (single-select, multi-select, etc.). This approach essentially turns the LLM into a UI composer – the model decides which UI element to use and the client carries it out in real time.

Best Practices: When using markup-driven UI, it’s crucial to choose a format that the model can reliably produce and that won’t conflict with normal output. The demo above chose bracketed tags like [CHOICE] and a special icon notation to avoid confusion with actual code or Markdown. Prompting the model with clear instructions and examples of the markup is essential so it knows when to use them. On the client, robust parsing is needed – e.g. gracefully handle if the model’s format has minor errors or extraneous text. Logging and testing different model outputs can help refine the markup spec to maximize reliability.

This method keeps the conversation flow seamless (the UI selection is part of the chat history), but it does put a lot of trust in the LLM to follow the expected format. In practice, high-quality models (GPT-4-level) guided by good prompts can do this quite well, while smaller models might occasionally slip (the AI Rabbit demo notes that their smaller model sometimes mis-outputs an icon code). To mitigate issues, developers sometimes implement a post-processor to correct or validate the model’s markup before rendering.
2. Tool/Function-Based UI Actions
Another robust pattern is to treat UI interactions as tools or functions that the LLM can invoke, rather than as raw text. With the rise of structured function calling in OpenAI and frameworks like LangChain, we can define functions for UI prompts – for example, a function request_user_choice(options: List[str]) that, when invoked, signals the frontend to present those options to the user. The LLM doesn’t directly emit the UI markup; instead it “calls” a function which the system intercepts to render UI.

OpenAI Function Calling Approach: In OpenAI’s API, you can register a function (say, request_date()) with a description like “Ask the user to pick a date”. When the model decides it needs user input, it can return a function_call JSON (e.g. {"name": "request_date", "arguments": "{...}"}) instead of a normal message. Your application sees this and knows to pause the LLM’s response and prompt the user via an interactive date-picker UI. HubSpot’s Dharmesh Shah describes this strategy as giving the LLM “tools that allow human input.” The LLM “uses the tool to get that input, and we show an inline UI control for the user to enter” the data. For example, if a date is needed, the model calls a get_date function; the frontend might pop up a calendar widget. You could similarly have tools for text input, dropdown selection, confirmation dialogs, etc.. Once the user provides the info (e.g. picks a date), your code passes it back into the conversation (often as a new user message or as the return value of the function call) so the LLM can continue with that knowledge.

This tool-based approach can be implemented with LangChain agents as well. LangChain allows defining custom tools that an agent (LLM) can use. For instance, one could define a SelectOptionTool that when used, halts the agent and waits for user selection. Under the hood, this might simply output something like "<<SELECT \"Option A\",\"Option B\" >>" which your UI knows how to handle, but using the tool abstraction makes it more systematic. In practice, a LangChain agent using OpenAI function calling would be similar: the agent’s tool is exposed as a function; the LLM “calls” it, then your code triggers the UI and eventually returns the choice back to the agent.

Example – Interactive Tool in Code: Imagine a pseudo-code using OpenAI’s API:

# Define a function that the model can call to offer choices
functions = [
  {
    "name": "offer_choices",
    "description": "Offer user a list of choices and wait for selection.",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "options": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": {"type": "string"},
          "description": "The list of options to present."
        }
      },
      "required": ["options"]
    }
  }
]

# ... call the ChatCompletion with these functions ...
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(..., functions=functions, function_call="auto")

# Check if a function was called
msg = response['choices'][0]['message']
if msg.get("function_call"):
    if msg['function_call']['name'] == "offer_choices":
        opts = json.loads(msg['function_call']['arguments'])['options']
        # TODO: render these options as buttons in the UI and wait for user click
        user_choice = await wait_for_button_click(opts)
        # Feed the user's choice back to the model as the next user message...

The above outlines how the model can ask for a choice via a function call. A Reddit discussion on this pattern confirms that when the model’s reply indicates a function call, the application can execute the function and update the UI element (like a carousel or list) with the results, before even calling the model again. In many cases, you might not need an immediate second LLM call – the user’s selection itself is the next input to continue the dialogue.

UI Framework Support: Some higher-level frameworks make this easier. Chainlit (open-sourced in 2023) is a Python framework specifically for LLM apps that has built-in support for buttons and other controls. In Chainlit, you can attach cl.Action buttons to any chatbot message with a couple lines of code. For example, to send a message with two choice buttons:

actions = [
    cl.Action(name="approve", label="Approve", value="yes"), 
    cl.Action(name="reject", label="Reject", value="no")
]
await cl.Message(content="Do you approve?", actions=actions).send()

This would render a message “Do you approve?” with “Approve” and “Reject” buttons in the UI. Each Action has a name and a payload/value. You then define a Python callback to handle the click, e.g., using @cl.action_callback("approve") to catch the "Approve" button and run some code. Chainlit abstracts the web UI (it uses a React frontend under the hood with websockets to your Python backend) so that you as a developer simply call a Python function to create UI elements. This is a form of the tool-based approach because the LLM doesn’t generate the button markup – your app logic decides when to present a cl.Action (possibly based on LLM’s intent or conversation state). It’s very effective for ensuring reliability since the LLM isn’t directly responsible for the UI syntax.

Other tools follow similar ideas: Streamlit, while not LLM-specific, allows quick web app UIs in Python and can be used to build chat interfaces with widgets (e.g. st.button, st.selectbox). A developer can update the Streamlit app state after each model response – for instance, if the bot should present a selection next, you could render a st.radio() for the user. Streamlit handles state via re-execution on each interaction, so you’d need to manage conversation history carefully (often storing it in st.session_state). Gradio is another popular library for chat UIs (used in many HuggingFace demos); it has a high-level gr.ChatInterface and components for buttons, dropdowns, etc. While Gradio doesn’t let the model dynamically add new UI elements mid-conversation without some coding, you can design a Gradio interface that, say, shows preset option buttons for certain responses. Some projects have used Gradio with custom parsing of model outputs to achieve a similar effect.

OpenAI’s Function Calling & React/JS Frontends: In JavaScript frontends (for example, a custom React app using the OpenAI JS SDK or your own backend), function calls are equally powerful. The model’s function call response can be routed to trigger a state update in the UI. E.g., if {"function_call": {"name": "offer_choices", "arguments": "{'options': ['A','B','C']}"}} comes back, your React app could intercept this and set a state like pendingOptions = ['A','B','C'] to display a menu. The chat UI might show a special message like “(Choose an option...)” with corresponding buttons. When clicked, the choice can be inserted into the message list and sent to the model as the next user turn. This pattern keeps a strict separation: LLM decides when to ask for input (by calling the function), and the UI logic decides how to ask for it (rendering the actual form element).

Advantages: Tool-based methods tend to be more reliable than raw text markers because the model’s intent is captured structurally (no fragile string parsing). They also allow the developer to manage complex interactions explicitly in code – which can simplify debugging and maintenance when many possible UI paths exist. You can centrally handle what happens on each button click or form submit (logging it, validating it, etc., before feeding to the model).

Challenges: This approach can make the overall architecture more complex: you need a mechanism to pause and resume the conversation (since the model may yield control to the UI mid-response). Essentially your chat loop must accommodate an “interrupt” where it waits for user input via the UI tool. State management becomes important – for example, you might label in the conversation history that “the assistant invoked tool X” and hold the next assistant message until the user reacts. LangChain’s agent framework or custom state machines can help manage this multi-turn orchestration. The payoff is a very deterministic interactive flow, suitable for high-stakes or structured dialogues (forms, multi-step workflows, etc.).
3. Hybrid Strategies
Many systems in practice use a mix of the above approaches, tailored to the use case. Some hybrid patterns include:

Model-suggested, Code-refined UI: The LLM may output a list of suggestions in plain text, and the frontend (seeing a pattern like a numbered list) proactively turns them into buttons. This is a semi-automated approach – not as formal as a markup language, but still adding UI affordances. For example, if the bot message ends with “1. Option A  2. Option B”, the UI could detect that and render quick-reply buttons labeled “Option A” and “Option B”. This requires careful parsing to avoid false positives, but can work for simple scenarios.

Markup + Function Combo: One might use structured function calls for major interactions and still allow the model to format minor UI elements via markup. For instance, a bot could call a show_chart(data) function to render a complex chart in the UI (tool-based), while using a lightweight markup to style its textual answer with a collapsible section or icon (markup-based). Because function calling is currently focused on back-end tool use, some developers augment it with a custom front-end markup for finer control over presentation.

Stateful Form Filling: In cases where the chatbot needs to gather several pieces of information, a common pattern is a guided form: The model might first decide “I need X, Y, Z from the user.” This could be done via multiple sequential function calls (e.g. request_X, then request_Y, etc.), or the model could output a single composite form specification (like a JSON with multiple fields). The UI can then present a form with all required inputs at once. After the user fills it and submits, the results are fed back to the model. This reduces back-and-forth. The trade-off is the model has to anticipate all needed fields up front or the developer must orchestrate a loop of function calls. Research prototypes like Biscuit (2024) explore this by having the LLM generate “ephemeral UIs” (like sliders, checkboxes) in notebooks to collect parameters before final code generation – a similar idea can apply to chatbots for forms.

Human-in-the-loop confirmations: Sometimes an agent might autonomously do things but require user confirmation for safety (“Do you want me to send this email I drafted?”). A best practice is to use either a special confirmation tool or a dedicated UI element for this. For example, the model could invoke confirm_action(details) and the UI shows a Yes/No dialog with those details. Only if the user clicks “Yes” does the action proceed. This pattern ensures the UI state (pending approval) is clear and the model doesn’t continue until a decision is made.

Managing Complexity & State: As interactive branches increase, managing state is key. It’s wise to keep an explicit conversation state object that tracks things like “awaiting_user_input: True/False” and perhaps what input is expected. Frameworks can help: for example, Chainlit manages session state and can queue events so that a user click triggers the correct callback even if other messages streamed in the meantime. If building from scratch with React or similar, leveraging state management (Redux, Zustand, etc.) can help keep the UI in sync with the conversation’s status. Each interactive element could carry an identifier so the backend knows which question was answered. Logging and analytics are also easier if you formalize these interactions (you can record that “User chose Option B at step 3” separately from raw chat text).

Ensuring Reliability: A common best practice is to design the system such that the LLM’s role is to decide what to ask, while the application ensures how to ask it is consistent. This means not relying solely on the AI to remember UI syntax or state. For instance, if the user clicks a button, you don’t blindly trust the model to handle that – you feed it back as a user message or function result. That way the model just sees “User chose X” in the conversation history, which it can safely work with, rather than trying to parse some UI code. In the markup approach, this is handled by the client injecting the choice text as a user turn. In the function approach, it’s by supplying the function’s return value to the model. In all cases, the hand-off between UI and LLM should be well-defined (e.g., always encapsulate user selections in a consistent format like User: [Option chosen]). This prevents the model from getting off-track or hallucinating that the user said something they didn’t.
Frameworks, Libraries, and Tools in Use
React Front-Ends: Many open-source chat UIs (and company implementations) use React or similar web frameworks for the front-end. React’s component model is well-suited to conditionally rendering different UI elements based on state. The FluidChat demo (by AI Rabbit) is a React app that implemented the custom markup parser and interactive components (the snippet in their blog shows a React renderOptions function). Using React (or Vue/Angular) gives full control over the UI/UX – you can design rich interactive messages, update them live, show animations, etc. The trade-off is needing web development expertise. Many projects address this by either providing ready components or abstracting it away:

Chainlit: as described, lets Python developers add UI elements without writing JS/HTML directly. It includes high-level abstractions for messages, actions (buttons), file uploads, etc., and manages the socket communication and state for you. It’s open-source and often used to wrap LangChain agents with an interface quickly. Chainlit’s design emphasizes streaming responses and multi-step agent reasoning visualization by default, which is great for agentic bots.

Streamlit: not chat-specific, but its simplicity makes it a frequent choice in LLM demos and internal tools. A developer can prototype an interface with a conversation history display (st.chat_message) and use widgets for input. One can, for example, call st.button("Option A") after outputting a bot message, and if that returns True (clicked), act accordingly. Streamlit handles UI reactivity declaratively, which can simplify or complicate things depending on the logic structure. It’s very approachable for data scientists and was used in many “ChatGPT clone” tutorials in 2023–2024.

Gradio: often seen in Hugging Face community demos. It provides a <Chatbot> component that by default just appends messages, but you can combine it with other Gradio components (dropdowns, checkboxes) to gather input. Some developers have made the chatbot suggest options by returning special values that populate a Gradio dropdown for the next user turn, for example. Gradio is great for quick web hosting (e.g. via HuggingFace Spaces) and now also supports event hooks that could let you inject UI changes mid-conversation.

LangChain + Custom UI: LangChain itself doesn’t provide a UI, but it integrates easily with the above. Many LangChain-based apps use Streamlit or Gradio for front-ends. There are community projects like LangChain UI or LLMChat (a multi-model chat interface) that provide a web UI around LangChain pipelines. When targeting Slack, LangChain offers a Slack toolkit (wrapping Slack Web API calls) which can be part of an agent’s toolset to, say, retrieve Slack messages or post results back. However, to implement interactive buttons in Slack, you typically use Slack’s own interface features rather than LangChain directly.

Slack Integration: Slack supports rich interactive messages through its Block Kit UI framework. A Slack bot can send a message with JSON specifying buttons, menus, date pickers, etc., and can listen for interactions (via request URLs or Socket mode). Any web-based chatbot pattern can be adapted to Slack by mapping the desired interaction to a Slack block. For example, if your LLM agent wants to ask a multiple-choice question, your Slack app can post a message with Slack “actions” (buttons) for each choice. When the user clicks, Slack sends your app an event with the button’s value, and your app then feeds that into the LLM for the next response. Slack’s new AI App support (in beta) essentially encourages this model: your app runs an LLM-powered conversation in a thread, and you can inject interactive components as needed. Best practices on Slack include using message update APIs if you want to edit the bot’s message (e.g. to reflect that an option was chosen), and using ephemeral messages or modals for private inputs. Slack blocks are declarative JSON, so your code (or LLM via a function) can generate that JSON on the fly. One could even imagine using an LLM function-calling approach where the model outputs a function create_poll(options=[...]) and your code translates that into a Slack message with buttons. In short, Slack provides the UI primitives, and your LLM provides the brain – you just connect them.

Example: A Slack AI assistant might ask “Would you like a summary of this thread?” and include “Yes”/“No” buttons. If “Yes” is clicked (an interactive component event), the backend calls the LLM to generate the summary and then posts it. This is analogous to a web UI button click. The Slack platform handles the rendering and the click delivery, so your focus is just on the logic when an action comes in. Many open-source Slack bot templates (e.g. the Slack-samples AI chatbot) show how to integrate an LLM response flow, though they may not explicitly show on-the-fly buttons. You can extend those to include interactive blocks easily (Slack’s API docs provide examples of adding buttons to messages).
Best Practices Summary
To ensure reliability in interactive LLM chats, prefer structured signals over free-form text when possible. OpenAI’s function calling and LangChain’s tool invocation are excellent for this – the model explicitly “requests” an input or an action, and your code faithfully carries it out. If using a markup or magic string method, design the markup to be unambiguous and keep the set of supported UI elements limited to what you can parse confidently. Always include a fallback for unexpected model outputs (e.g. if the model fails to follow format, your app might simply display the raw text to the user rather than breaking).

Managing complexity means keeping the dialogue flow understandable. It helps to break the problem down: for multi-turn form filling, treat it as distinct steps with their own prompts/tools, rather than one giant prompt trying to handle everything. Document the interactive protocol (whether it’s function names or markup tags) so that it’s clear to future maintainers how the LLM and UI coordinate. Using well-maintained frameworks (Chainlit, etc.) can reduce boilerplate and let you focus on the conversation design. Also consider the user experience: ensure that the UI elements make sense in context and don’t overwhelm. For example, if an LLM provides 10 options, maybe use a dropdown or paginate them, rather than 10 buttons in a row. These are classic UI concerns now intersecting with AI.

For UI reactivity and state, real-time feedback is key. If the bot is working or waiting, show a loading indicator or disable inputs accordingly. Many chat UIs (including Slack’s AI app panel) support showing a typing… or spinner state. If using a custom web UI, implement a websocket or streaming response so that the user sees that the bot is thinking or streaming an answer. This keeps the user engaged during multi-step tool interactions. Chainlit, for instance, automatically shows a typing indicator when the LLM is responding, and you can manually set “status” messages in Slack’s API (like Slack’s assistant.threads.setStatus to display a loading state).

Finally, design with extensibility in mind. Today it might be buttons and text inputs; soon you may integrate sliders, file pickers, or even visual canvas elements. A well-architected agent can handle new UI tools with minimal changes to the core logic. Several prototypes (e.g. Anthropic’s Artifacts, OpenAI’s Canvas) are exploring richer response formats (HTML, images, charts) – we can expect future APIs to support more native interactive components. Keeping the UI layer modular and the LLM-interface layer clearly defined will make it easier to adopt such features when they arrive.
Conclusion
In the past year, web-based LLM chatbots with agentic behavior have begun to blend traditional GUI elements into the chat paradigm, yielding more fluid and efficient interactions. Whether via LLM-generated markup or explicit tool/function calls, the consensus is that moving beyond pure text can greatly enhance usability without losing the flexibility of natural language. Open-source projects like Chainlit provide templates for implementing these ideas, and custom solutions like the ChatUI 3.0 demo show that even complex multi-step interactions (travel planning with multiple selections, etc.) are feasible and intuitive. By following the emerging best practices – using structured communication between the LLM and UI, managing state carefully, and leveraging existing UI frameworks – developers can build chatbots that feel much more interactive and “alive” to users. Importantly, these patterns extend to platforms like Slack or Teams by mapping bot intents to each platform’s interactive message capabilities, so your agent can live where the users are. As LLM applications mature, this convergence of conversational AI and dynamic UI will likely become a standard design pattern for AI assistants.
