# Trust & Rules Architecture for Multi-Tenant Agent System

## Overview
A progressive trust system that allows agents to gain more autonomy as they demonstrate reliability, with customer-specific rule sets and trust configurations.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Trust Level Hierarchy
```
Trust Levels (0-5)
├── Level 0: Observer Only
│   ├── Can view conversations
│   ├── Can suggest responses (human must approve)
│   └── All actions logged for training
│
├── Level 1: Basic Responder
│   ├── Can send informational responses
│   ├── Can answer FAQs
│   ├── Can provide product information
│   └── Cannot make any system changes
│
├── Level 2: Support Agent
│   ├── Everything from Level 1
│   ├── Can look up order information
│   ├── Can create support tickets
│   ├── Can offer standard solutions
│   └── Still no financial actions
│
├── Level 3: Trusted Support
│   ├── Everything from Level 2
│   ├── Can issue store credits (with limits)
│   ├── Can modify orders (before shipping)
│   ├── Can apply discount codes
│   └── All financial actions logged & reversible
│
├── Level 4: Senior Agent
│   ├── Everything from Level 3
│   ├── Can process refunds (with limits)
│   ├── Can override certain policies
│   ├── Can escalate to human only for edge cases
│   └── Higher financial action limits
│
└── Level 5: Fully Autonomous
    ├── Everything from Level 4
    ├── No financial limits (within customer-set bounds)
    ├── Can handle all standard operations
    └── Only escalates true anomalies
```

### 2. Customer-Specific Configuration Structure
```
/customers
├── {customer_id}/
│   ├── trust_config.yaml
│   │   ├── current_trust_level: 2
│   │   ├── trust_history: [...]
│   │   └── trust_metrics: {...}
│   │
│   ├── rules/
│   │   ├── refund_policy.yaml
│   │   ├── shipping_issues.yaml
│   │   ├── product_complaints.yaml
│   │   └── escalation_triggers.yaml
│   │
│   ├── limits/
│   │   ├── financial_limits.yaml
│   │   │   ├── max_refund_amount: 500
│   │   │   ├── max_credit_amount: 100
│   │   │   └── daily_total_limit: 2000
│   │   │
│   │   └── action_limits.yaml
│   │       ├── max_refunds_per_day: 10
│   │       └── max_overrides_per_week: 5
│   │
│   └── prompts/
│       ├── system_prompt_overrides.yaml
│       └── workflow_customizations.yaml
```

### 3. Trust Progression System

#### Trust Metrics
```yaml
trust_metrics:
  accuracy:
    description: "Percentage of correct actions taken"
    weight: 0.4
    current_value: 0.95
    threshold_for_promotion: 0.98
    
  escalation_rate:
    description: "How often agent correctly escalates"
    weight: 0.2
    current_value: 0.88
    threshold_for_promotion: 0.90
    
  customer_satisfaction:
    description: "Post-interaction ratings"
    weight: 0.2
    current_value: 4.2
    threshold_for_promotion: 4.5
    
  policy_adherence:
    description: "Following customer-specific rules"
    weight: 0.2
    current_value: 0.99
    threshold_for_promotion: 0.99
```

#### Automatic Trust Adjustment
```
Trust Evaluation Pipeline
├── Continuous Monitoring
│   ├── Track all agent actions
│   ├── Monitor customer feedback
│   └── Check policy compliance
│
├── Periodic Evaluation (daily/weekly)
│   ├── Calculate weighted trust score
│   ├── Compare against thresholds
│   └── Check for red flags
│
├── Trust Adjustment Decision
│   ├── Promotion: All metrics above threshold for X days
│   ├── Maintain: Metrics stable
│   └── Demotion: Any critical failure or sustained poor performance
│
└── Notification & Logging
    ├── Alert customer of trust level change
    ├── Log reasoning and metrics
    └── Update configuration files
```

### 4. Rule Engine Integration

#### Rule Structure Example
```yaml
# /customers/{customer_id}/rules/shipping_issues.yaml
shipping_delay_response:
  conditions:
    - issue_type: "shipping_delay"
    - days_delayed: ">= 3"
  
  actions_by_trust_level:
    0-1:
      - action: "apologize_and_check_status"
      - action: "escalate_to_human"
    
    2-3:
      - action: "apologize_and_check_status"
      - action: "offer_shipping_credit"
        max_amount: 10
    
    4-5:
      - action: "apologize_and_check_status"
      - action: "offer_shipping_credit"
        max_amount: 25
      - action: "offer_expedited_replacement"
        conditions:
          - product_value: "< 100"
```

### 5. Integration with Existing Architecture

#### Modified File Structure
```
/agents
├── prompts/
│   ├── base/                    # Shared base prompts
│   └── customers/               # Customer overrides
│       └── {customer_id}/
│           ├── system_prompt_v1.yaml
│           └── trust_modifiers.yaml
│
├── workflows/
│   ├── base/                    # Base workflows
│   └── customers/
│       └── {customer_id}/
│           ├── workflow_v1.yaml
│           └── trust_gates.yaml  # Trust-based branches
│
└── trust/
    ├── engine/                  # Trust evaluation logic
    ├── metrics/                 # Metric collectors
    └── reports/                 # Trust reports by customer
```

#### Workflow Modifications
```yaml
# Example workflow with trust gates
workflow:
  steps:
    - id: "identify_issue"
      action: "classify_customer_issue"
    
    - id: "trust_gate_1"
      type: "trust_check"
      required_level: 2
      on_success: "proceed_to_solution"
      on_fail: "escalate_to_human"
    
    - id: "proceed_to_solution"
      action: "determine_best_solution"
      
    - id: "trust_gate_2"
      type: "trust_check"
      required_level: 3
      check_specific_permission: "issue_refund"
      on_success: "execute_solution"
      on_fail: "propose_solution_for_approval"
```

### 6. Implementation Considerations

#### Security & Audit Trail
```
Audit System
├── Every Action Logged
│   ├── Timestamp
│   ├── Agent ID
│   ├── Customer ID
│   ├── Trust level at time
│   ├── Action taken
│   ├── Justification
│   └── Outcome
│
├── Reversibility
│   ├── All financial actions reversible
│   ├── Rollback procedures defined
│   └── Human override always available
│
└── Compliance Reporting
    ├── Generate trust reports
    ├── Show decision paths
    └── Demonstrate policy adherence
```

#### Gradual Rollout Strategy
```
Deployment Phases
├── Phase 1: Shadow Mode
│   ├── Agent suggests actions
│   ├── Human executes
│   └── Build trust metrics
│
├── Phase 2: Limited Automation
│   ├── Start at Trust Level 1
│   ├── Automate safe actions only
│   └── Monitor closely
│
├── Phase 3: Progressive Trust
│   ├── Enable trust progression
│   ├── Allow higher-level actions
│   └── Customer-controlled pace
│
└── Phase 4: Full Autonomy
    ├── Agents can reach Level 5
    ├── Minimal human intervention
    └── Continuous optimization
```

### 7. Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Risk Mitigation**: Start conservative, increase autonomy based on proven performance
2. **Customer Control**: Each customer defines their own rules and comfort levels
3. **Transparency**: Clear audit trails and reasoning for all decisions
4. **Flexibility**: Easy to adjust trust levels and rules without code changes
5. **Scalability**: File-based system maintains simplicity while supporting multi-tenancy

### 8. Integration Points

#### With Existing Editor UI
- Add "Trust Level" selector in playground
- Show trust gates in workflow editor
- Display current permissions in agent view
- Add trust metrics dashboard

#### With Version Control
- Trust level changes create new versions
- Rule modifications tracked in git
- Easy rollback of trust decisions
- A/B testing different trust strategies

## Next Steps

1. Define initial trust metrics and thresholds
2. Create trust evaluation engine
3. Build rule parser for customer-specific policies
4. Add trust gates to workflow system
5. Create audit and reporting system
6. Design customer dashboard for trust management
