# North Star

- Control our own destiny. We default make decisions that are based on things we control. External capital is something we have input on but do not control. We plan for self sufficiency. E.g. we time box this planning for external capital and then move on assuming it’s not coming.
- Focus at the cost of expansion every time.
- Compete by completely changing the framing. Win by playing a different game

# Dirt-Simple "One-Pager" Structure

*Minimum moving parts, still meets every stated goal*
## 1. LEGAL ENTITY SET-UP

- **Delaware C-Corp "HireCJ, Inc."**
- **Day-0:** Cratejoy forms HireCJ and owns 100% (clean chain of title)
## 2. SHARE ISSUANCE *(same morning)*

**Authorize 12M common shares. Issue:**
- **5.0M to Cratejoy for:**
  - Exclusive, perpetual IP license
  - $900k cash (delivered as harvested)
- **1.5M to Amir** (founder stock)
- **1.5M to Blake** (founder stock)
- **0.5M to Dan** (founder stock)
- **1.5M to 2025 ESOP**
- **2.0M reserved "Milestone Pool"** (board-controlled)
**Results:** CJ 41.7% | Founders 29.2% | ESOP 12.5% | Pool 16.6%
## 3. PARITY & OWNERSHIP PROTECTION

**Milestone Pool rules (board resolutions):**
- **+0.5% to Dan** at CJ wind-down
- **+0.5% to each founder** at $1M ARR
- **+1.0% to each founder** at Series-A close (fills the 2M pool; lifts founders to ≥40% FD post-A, Dan matches)
- **All founder stock** 4-yr vest / 1-yr cliff; vest stops on termination
## 4. SEED ROUND PRIMER

**Raise $XX TBD **2.5M new shares (20%)
**Post-Seed cap table** (12M+2.5M=14.5M FD, pre-option exercise):
- **CJ:** 5.0M (34.5%)
- **CRV Seed:** 2.5M (17.2%)
- **Amir:** 1.5M (10.3%)
- **Blake:** 1.5M (10.3%)
- **Dan:** 0.5M (3.4%)
- **ESOP:** 1.5M (10.3%)
- **Milestone pool:** 2.0M (13.8%) *(unissued)*
**Founders (issued) = 24.0% now; ≥40% after pool triggers**
## 5. FUTURE CLEAN-UP CLAUSE

**Board/Stockholder Agreement states:** when CJ liabilities ≤$100k OR Series A closes, CJ will distribute its HireCJ shares pro-rata to CJ shareholders (or flip-merge if tax-optimal). Removes "parent hair."
## 6. CRATEJOY CARETAKER & FUNDING FLOW

- **CJ continues ops** with Dan 0.25 FTE + 1 VA
- **Management-Services Agreement:** CJ pays HireCJ $25k/mo for 18 months max
  - Pays Dan/Amir/Blake $100k each/yr (split equally) for legacy work
- **CJ cash beyond that follows schedule:**
  - First $900k fulfils equity purchase
  - Excess stays at CJ for debt buffer or optional dividend
## 7. FOUNDER COMP CASHFLOW

- **HireCJ base salaries:** $150k each (Seed money)
- **CJ service fee:** +$100k each (non-Seed cash)
- **Total Year-1 cash ≈$250k per founder,** inside Seed "<20% of round" rule
- **Catch-Up Bonus** $100k each at $4M ARR or Series-A; board-approved
## 8. GOVERNANCE

- **3-seat Board:** Amir, CRV, Independent (to be named ≤90 days)
- **CEO (Amir)** may hire/fire; Board retains normal oversight
- **CJ shares** are non-pref, vote pro-rata with common
## 9. IP & QSBS

- **IP license** exclusive, perpetual; reverts only if HireCJ ceases ops
- **Founder shares** issued at <$0.01; QSBS clock starts immediately
## 10. SHUT-DOWN / EXIT PATHS

- **If HireCJ sold** → single-trigger acceleration applies to unvested founder stock
- **If CJ sold** before share dividend, buyer receives plain common only
## Summary

**This skeleton hits every requirement:**
- Founders hit $250k cash without over-burning Seed
- Founders ≥40% FD post-Series A, Dan reaches parity via milestones
- CJ cash becomes equity; CRV double-covered
- Minimal legal hair for outside Series-A: parent stake is common, pre-agreed to disappear

# Board Materials 5/29

## "Outcome is highly path dependent"

## Our market is dying so we built an AI team by accident

### Marketplace and Platform Reality Check

- **Growth Plateaued:** GMV and platform sales last peaked in 2019; the 2020 COVID bump proved transitory.
- **Margin Compression:** Low-margin, high-volume sellers now drive >40% of GMV, diluting take-rate and platform profitability.
- **Sustained Contraction:** GMV and revenue have declined year-over-year for three straight fiscal years with no stabilization to date.
- **Liquidity Tightness:** FY-25 outlook shows only $16k cash at year-end and a –$41k trough projected for November 2025.
### Platform GMV Chart

- Peak GMV: $306.5M (2020)
- 2026 projection: ~$50M
### New Marketplace GMV Chart

- Peak: $27.9M (2020)
- 2026 projection: ~$4.2M
### Platform and MP Revenue Chart

- 2023: Platform $3.3M, MP Rev $4.7M
- 2026 projection: Platform $1.5M, MP Rev $2.2M
## Our sh*t works (we didn't have a choice)

### Key Metrics

- **64.9% Auto-resolved**
- **1 Min Median First-reply** (vs 20h pre-CJ)

**100% Automated:**
- ✓ Cancel subscription
- ✓ Where-is-my-order / tracking
- ✓ Password resets & invite links
- ✓ Refund orders
**0 CSAT drop** (customers can't tell it's AI)
### What's Next?

- Close "double-charge" edge-cases
- Dual-charge investigator ships 7/01 → another +15 pp
- Trajectory → ~75% auto-resolution in 30 days, 90%+ by Q3
*Source: Freshdesk logs Nov '24-May '25 (4,403 support tickets)*

## AI team members, specialized for e-com, doing real work

### CJ • "See-Jay" (she/AI)

**Autonomous CX & Growth Officer**
Built by Cratejoy. Trained on 8 million real subscription conversations.
- AI Teammate
- Austin / @ Cloud / Cratejoy
**Key Features:**
- 2,500+ Founder Connections
- 70% Ticket Deflection
- $18M GMV Influenced
**About:** I'm CJ—an always-on AI teammate, not a human applicant. Cratejoy built me to delete founder busywork after training on 13 years of subscription-commerce history, millions of customer tickets, and more product-feedback than a focus group could dream of.
- My creators run a $200-million-plus DTC business on Cratejoy; I've been in the trenches with them every day for the last two years.
- I've seen every growth curve—from side-hustle to 8-figure rocket—and turned the patterns into playbooks that execute themselves.
- My mission: delete founders' busy-work, compound their LTV, and make "out of office" a reality again.
### Customer Testimonial

**"Would easily pay $1k/month to replace my $50k employees"** (Tamira @ Dear Delta)
## $1.5B of Grunt-Work Up for Grabs

### Market Opportunity

**Current Human CX Spend:** $1.5B
**Same Tickets if CJ Handles 70%:** $400M
**32,000** mid-market merchants × $48k avg support payroll = $1.54B burned on repetitive tickets
- ✓ 1 ticket ≈ $8 human cost
- ✓ CJ target cost ≈ $2
**Automating 70% of tickets unlocks >$1B in margin—ripe for whoever moves first.**
*Margin > 94%

## 2025 -> 2026 Financial Projections

### Key Issues:

- **Q4:** cash goes negative
- **Year-end debt service wipes out $86K RBF line**
- **Further variable-marketing cuts negligible** (ROAS already <3 mo payback)
- **Excludes any extra losses from split focus away from Cratejoy**
- **Can stave off liquidity lockup until Q2 with additional RBF, but we're out of easy options at that point - This is just an escalating debt treadmill**

## Additional Financial Analyses

### Revenue from Phase 1 alone (modest growth)



| Release Date | 2025 Revenue | 2026 Revenue | 2025 ARR | 2026 ARR |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 9/1 | $75k | $3.6M | $370k | $11.2M |

### Pricing Architecture

#### Pricing Arch Idea #1: Seat + Meter (Support Basics)

**AI Base seat:**
- 24/7 WISMO Email/Chat
- 1k resolutions included in base price
- Pricing Bands:
  - **Starter (<$1M GMV):** $299/mo flat + 0.60c per additional resolution over 1k
  - **Growth ($1M-$10M GMV):** $999/mo flat + 0.45c
  - **Scale (>10M):** $2,499/mo flat + 0.30c
**Example volumes/ACV:**
- Starter w/250 tickets/mo: $3,600 + $1,200 volume = $4,800
- Growth w/1000 tickets/mo: $12,000 + $7,000 volume = $19,000
- Scale w/6000 tickets/mo: $30,000 + $22,000 volume = $52,000
### Pricing Comparison to BPO



| Tier | Tickets/Touches | Reps Needed | US Rep (Annual) | BPO Rep (Ann) | CJ AI Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Starter (<1M) | 250 | 1.5 | $90,000 | $45,000 | $4,800 |
| Growth (1-10M) | 900 | 4 | $240,000 | $120,000 | $19,000 |
| Scale (>10M) | 4,000 | 6 | $360,000 | $180,000 | $52,000 |
| Enterprise | 10k+ | 10+ | $500k+ | $200k+ | $100k+ |

*Not modeling enterprise, just here for entertainment purposes*
### Unit Economics: 75% Cost Reduction

- **$48k** Avg Annual CX Payroll
- **$8** Human Cost per Ticket
- **$2** CJ Cost per Ticket
- **75%** Cost Reduction
**Every merchant saves $33.6k annually when CJ handles 70% of tickets**
## Executive Summary: The Strategic Fork in the Road

### Status Quo

Current trajectory drags cash into early-2026 before liquidity bottoms out.
### Option 1 — Full AI-Agent Pivot

- **Resource mix:** 5 FTE on Agents, 1 FTE on Marketplace.
- **Upside:** Largest revenue lift projected for 2026.
- **Risk:** Greater cash-flow exposure; any slip in launch or adoption quickly drains remaining runway.
### Option 2 — Hybrid Approach

- **Resource mix:** 4 FTE on Marketplace, 2 FTE on Agents.
- **Upside:** Slows marketplace erosion while staging Agent rollout.
- **Risk:** Much smaller 2026 upside versus full pivot, but materially lower liquidity stress.
## Projected Liquidity & ARR by Strategic Path (FY 2025 – 2026)



| Plan | 2025 Cash Trough | 2025 EOY Cash | 2026 Cash Trough | 2026 EOY Cash | 2026 ARR |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Today | -$41k (Oct) | $16k | -$192k (Oct) | -$56k | $8M* |
| Hybrid Focus | -$41k (Nov) | $65k | -$6k (Apr) | $400k | $11M |
| Agent Focus | -$70k (Nov) | -$61k | $8k (Jan) | $6M | $38M |

*8M ARR materially inflated by seasonal conditions in December
### Analysis:

- **Hybrid path**
  - Extends our cash runway through FY-25 but sacrifices momentum; major growth now shifts to 2026+.
  - Effectively this fully delays release and subsequent adoption trends by six months
- **AI Agent-first path**
  - Brings forward liquidity risk in FY-25 yet unlocks a materially larger revenue ramp in 2026.
## Risk Considerations

### Agent-First Path

- **Revenue Uncertainty:** Near-term topline likely to decelerate vs. prior model; forecasting error margin remains high
- **Brand Dilution:** Shifting focus away from marketplace risks eroding brand equity and customer trust.
- **Liquidity Exposure:** If agent adoption lags, runway compresses and we face a potential deep cash shortfall in Q4 2025 and into 2026.
### Hybrid Path

- **Runway Pressure:** Core revenues hold, yet cash balances trend to breakeven/negative in Q4 2025–Q1 2026.
- **Growth Deferral:** Agent launch pushed back several months, resulting in a slower ramp and deferred upside.

# Meeting Transcript

## 1. Pre-Meeting Chatter (00:02 – 00:46)

**Speaker 1:** Speak up. Hold on…
**Speaker 2:** (raising volume) Turning you up.
**Speaker 1:** Okay, I'm recording this. (pause)
**Speaker 3:** Doing well—still surviving.
**Speaker 4:** I'm visiting Alex this weekend… next weekend.
**Speaker 2:** What's the weather in Kentucky like right now?
**Speaker 4:** About 70 °F, partly sunny—nice, nice.
**Speaker 2:** You don't have to go to that burger place we like.
**Speaker 4:** Sure, sure. It's better than Copper Kitchen.
**Speaker 1:** (chuckles) Alright, so Blake's done multitasking… (brief silence) Well…
## 2. Setting the Table (00:46 – 03:11)

**Amir (CEO):** Look, we've talked a lot. This deck started as the thing we already know, and then it turned into me figuring out how I'd actually sell the product. But I'm happy to take the conversation anywhere you'd like.
What I'm focused on is making this happen—everything else is just context.
Financially, we're in a place where if we do nothing, we die—the only question is how fast.
Blake and I can't stop working on the new product; it's exciting—there's even a little greed around it because it feels right. But it's at risk: it's hard to breathe when the rest of the business has to pay everyone's salary.
Our plan:
- Get traction as fast as we can.
- If that works—great.
- Biggest risk: our already-split attention getting split even further.
**Devdutt (VC):** Nothing in here is new to me. You asked for specific things over e-mail and yesterday you asked some pricing questions. I mainly want an update on how your thinking has progressed.
**Amir (CEO):** Great—let's just run the deck linearly, then stop for questions.
## 3. Current Business Realities (03:11 – 07:55)

**Amir (CEO):** For a long time I felt like I was simply "doing things wrong," or that I "had the wrong people," but eventually it became undeniable: the market is dying.
The only way we even survived the last few years was by using AI aggressively. What we built—out of necessity—turns out to be far more valuable than propping up this market any further.
Facts:
- Stuff that should work simply isn't—no matter how hard we try.
- Even with cutting-edge tech it's not working.
- Dan looked at us a couple months ago and said, "Guys, I don't see us living through '26."
- Liquidity grind: every summer sucks, every winter used to make up for it—now the dip is too deep and we no longer have ammo for holidays. Two dips = game over.
## 4. Profitability & Cash Questions (07:55 – 13:20)

**Devdutt (VC):** You've cut head-count using AI, yet profitability hasn't gone up, CAC has gone up, margin has gone down, and every dime of take-rate has been squeezed.
Looking at the EBITDA line in the appendix—you're losing money every month. That business can't survive anything; it can only be a bridge to something else or be shut down. Also, the "cash balance" is mostly debt.
Why keep it going?
**Amir (CEO):** For a long time my answer was, "I can make it work." Then it became "I need the proving ground for our AI." Today? I don't know. The answers are weak: we have a seller reputation, a brand, etc. If I weren't excited about the AI stuff I would have recommended winding down long ago.
**Devdutt (VC):** Op-ex is roughly $2 M—half salaries, half software. You're basically done with the final pennies. Either pivot fast or prepare for shutdown.
## 5. The Two-Company Idea (13:20 – 19:20)

**Amir (CEO):** We want a way to stop thinking about Cratejoy and make HireCJ work. Cratejoy is finished; we should harvest it to fund the AI product we've built.
**Dan (CFO):** If we strip Cratejoy to the bone:
- Over the next 18 months it could throw off ≈ $2.5 M in cash.
- Rough split: ~$900 K this year, ~$1.3 M next. (After ~$300 K debt service.)
**Devdutt (VC):** Exactly. So:
- Treat them as two separate businesses.
- Cratejoy becomes a cash-cow subsidiary, staffed by a skeleton crew.
- HireCJ is spun up as a new entity:
  - 100% owned by current shareholders initially.
  - Re-cap so founders get ~30% (e.g., 15% each) and a 20% option pool.
  - Give Cratejoy staff upside in both entities to keep them motivated.
- This is how David Sacks handled Yammer/Socialmail—clean, fundable, and keeps everyone incentivized.
## 6. Staffing & Incentives (19:20 – 24:29)

**Amir (CEO):** Only one person really has to stay to milk Cratejoy—that's Dan. He owns ROI-driven decisions. Give him the team and incentives to maximize cash.
**Devdutt (VC):** And make sure people left in Cratejoy still hold equity in HireCJ. Their single mandate: generate cash.
*(Short back-and-forth on personal bandwidth, clean break vs. "messy hand-off," etc.)*
## 7. Clean-Break Reality Check (24:29 – 31:32)

**Amir (CEO):** There's no truly "clean" break.
- Shutdown? Massive energy; liabilities > cash; angry customers & shareholders; bad timing for launching a new product in the same space.
- Asset sale? Least clean; long diligence, escrow, reps & warranties.
- The least painful path is the "cash-cow + NewCo" model we just described.
## 8. Financing & What Devdutt Wants (31:32 – 36:11)

**Devdutt (VC):** Bottom-line:
- HireCJ is the only interesting thing.
- Cratejoy must be run with minimal attention.
- Show me:
  - A pared-down Cratejoy P&L that pays off debt and spits cash.
  - A fundable HireCJ plan with real growth targets.
  - How you'll give full focus to the new company.
- Get me those two P&Ls this week.
## 9. Product Road-Map & Timeline (36:11 – 55:08)

**Amir (CEO):** We're close—maybe 30-45 days—to an MVP that gives me conviction to "scream about it." I can't sell vaporware; I sell demos that excite.
Needed pieces:
- Trust / autonomy system so merchants know AI won't go rogue.
- Real on-boarding (today there is none).
- Tight Shopify Plus & Freshdesk connectors (mostly done).
**Devdutt (VC):** You showed me this months ago. Why aren't we shipping today?
*(Lively debate on "go faster," ticket deflection, pre- vs. post-purchase concierge, social-listening as a separate SKU, etc.)*
**Key takeaways:**
- Start with Support/Concierge—that's the wedge.
- Price like enterprise software; anchor high, discount later.
- Ignore tiny merchants; focus on Shopify Plus and up.
- Future modules (merchandising, marketing, etc.) form the long-term TAM story for investors.
## 10. Ideal Customer & Pricing (55:08 – 56:58)

**Devdutt (VC):** ICP must be tight: high-GMV, high-support cost merchants. Cut the noise. Vanity metrics mean nothing; only profit matters.
**Dan (CFO):** Preliminary tiers (subject to revision):
- Tier 1: $700–$1,600 / mo
- Tier 2: $1,600–$5,000 / mo
- Tier 3: Enterprise, 5-figure MRR + usage.
**Amir (CEO):** Agreed—small guys create noise for no value. Laser focus for at least 12 months.
## 11. Action Items & Next Steps (56:58 – End)

**Devdutt (VC):**
- Two P&Ls (Cratejoy stripped-down, HireCJ ramp-up) by week-end.
- Clear option/equity plan for everyone—no dangling promises.
- Move fast; my partnership is actively looking at AI deals now.
**Amir (CEO):** Understood. Dan and I will:
- Model both entities.
- Draft equity carve-outs.
- Send the deck + numbers in the next 24-36 hours.
*(Call ends with informal joking, file-sharing comments, and the team de-briefing privately about the homework.)*

# Amir's Non-Negotiables – Distilled

## Ownership Targets

- **Seed** (post-money, incl. CRV): Founders ≥ **50%**
- **Series A** (after new lead, fresh option refresh): Founders ≥ **40%**
- **Path-to-parity for Dan**: ends at same fully-diluted % as Amir & Blake by Series A (mechanism below)
## Cap-table Mechanics That Get Us There

### a. Day-0 (after CJ equity + founder stock + pool, before Seed)

- CJ HoldCo: **50%**
- Amir: **15%**
- Blake: **15%**
- Dan: **5%**
- ESOP (un-issued): **15%**
### b. Seed ($XMM @ $XM pre, CRV 20%)

- Founders still **45%**
- CJ **40%**, CRV **20%**, Founders **32%**, ESOP **8%**
### c. Founder top-up pool (3–4%)

- Held in reserve for Dan & milestone grants
- Equalises him by Series A
### d. At Series A, expect:

- New investor **20–25%**, option refresh **+5–8%**
- Using the top-up pool, founders stay **≥40%**
## Dan Parity Plan

- **Immediate:** 5% common + 5% of CJ net-cash (cash bonus)
- **Milestone equity:**
  - +½% at CJ wind-down
  - +½% at $1M ARR
  - +1% at Series A close
- **Catch-up option grant** from ESOP if above doesn't get him to Amir/Blake %
## Compensation / Lifestyle

- **Year-1 cash per founder ≈ $250k** (Seed-funded base $150k + CJ mgmt fee $100k)
- CJ fee sunsets after **18 mo** or CJ shutdown
- Board-approved catch-up bonus (**$100k**) at $4M ARR or Series A
## Control & Performance Protection

- **Amir retains CEO role** and unilateral firing authority (Board ratifies post-facto)
- All founder shares subject to **4-yr reverse vest / 1-yr cliff**; vest stops at termination
- **Single-trigger acceleration** only on HireCJ change-of-control
## Hairy-deal Clean-up (for future rounds)

- **CJ stake = plain common**, no prefs; shareholder agreement pledges pro-rata voting
- **Pre-wired clause:** CJ will distribute HireCJ shares to its own cap-table once liabilities cleared (eliminates parent entity later)
- **IP licensed exclusively**; reversion only if HireCJ shuts down
## Seed Round Optics

- **Founder salary burn = 11%** of round; R&D+GTM = **70%+**
- Founders contribute **>15 yrs domain expertise** + working product in prod
- **CRV double-dips** via CJ block; upside is aligned
**If these points hold,** you (Amir), Blake, and Dan keep adult cashflow, reach true parity, and still control **40%+** of HireCJ after a conventional Series A.

# INTERNAL MEMORANDUM

**Date:** [today]
**Subject:** Complete record of discussions, requirements and open points surrounding (a) Cratejoy "cash-harvest / wind-down" and (b) formation and funding of the HireCJ subsidiary.
**Prepared for:** Amir Elaguizy, Blake Messer, Dan Drewno**Requested:** "Exhaustive, fact-only synthesis; no recommendations"
## 0. PARTICIPANTS & ROLES (as referenced)

- **Devdutt Yellurkar** – General Partner, CRV; CJ board member.
- **Amir Elaguizy** – Co-founder/CEO Cratejoy; prospective CEO HireCJ.
- **Blake Messer** – Co-founder/Head of Product & GTM Cratejoy; prospective CPO HireCJ.
- **Dan Drewno** – Head of Finance Cratejoy; prospective CFO HireCJ; caretaker of CJ cash-harvest.
- **Alex Morse & others** – former CJ employees/advisors (mentioned but not decision-makers in this context).
## 1. DOCUMENTED COMMUNICATIONS WITH DEVDUTT

### A. E-mails 14 May 2025 → 26 May 2025

- Asked for updated P&L and cash-flow "based on the plans we discussed."
- Requested timing / ASP assumptions for the AI "agents" pivot.
- Set board call for 29 May 2025 to cover P&L plus pivot.
### B. "30-second financing" e-mail chain (16 May 2025)

- Amir asked whether future financing structure will allow "full-throttle" competition.
- On follow-up call Devdutt stated CRV "has history of working with pivots, spin-outs, even new entities" and "is not greedy on ownership."
### C. Board meeting Zoom transcript (24 May 2025) — key extracts

**Key Points:**
- Marketplace is a "declining asset"; summer liquidity dips will soon become fatal.
- CJ is "losing money every month"; only viable path is to treat it as a bridge to the AI agents business.
**Devdutt's explicit requests:**
- Two separate P&Ls: ① bare-bones CJ harvest; ② HireCJ growth.
- Figure out "revenue plan for Agents… timing of launch, average sales price."
- Present a structure where CJ cash becomes equity in NewCo ("think about the $900k coming out of Cratejoy as equity into HireCJ").
- Keep the founder team focused exclusively on HireCJ; assign one caretaker to CJ.
- Reference to "the David Sachs / Yammer spin-out model" as precedent.
- Direction to trim ICP to larger mid-market merchants (Shopify Plus), higher pricing, no small-merchant focus.
### D. Text threads (Sep 2024 – May 2025)

- Multiple confirmations that Devdutt is socialising the "e-commerce agents" story with CRV partners.
- On 1 May 2025 he relayed to partners that current CJ staff count had dropped from 35→6 using internal AI agents.
- During Austin visit (14 May 2025) he reiterated:
  - "Spin out the AI workers; keep founders motivated; price high; focus on $1-10M GMV merchants."
  - Introduced Harish Abbott (augment.com) as reference point for UI/engagement metrics.
- Continuous emphasis on removing low-value merchants and on producing a demo plus paid pilot LOIs "within 90 days."
## 2. DEVDUTT'S STATED OBJECTIVES / CONSTRAINTS

- Stop CJ burn; service debt; harvest cash.
- Form HireCJ initially as a wholly-owned CJ subsidiary, then issue founder stock/ESOP to dilute CJ to ≈50%.
- Inject first ±$0.9M of CJ cash into HireCJ as equity (common or SAFE).
- Provide dual financials so he can brief CRV partnership.
**ARR & pricing expectations for HireCJ:**
- Support-Agent MVP within 45 days of funding, ASP ≥$1-2k/agent/mo.
- 25 paid merchants in 90 days (original model showed lower numbers; he asked to "2-3× that").
- Maintain lean Seed burn; reference rule of thumb that founder cash comp ≤20% of Seed round.
- Long-term "clean-up" provision: ability to collapse CJ parent-ownership before Series A via share dividend or merger.
## 3. CRATEJOY ("LEGACY") – FACT SET

- Traffic ≈4M visits/mo, ARR ≈$4M, flat/gently declining.
- Headcount now 6 FTE after internal AI automation (down from 35).
- **Current salaries:** Amir $350k, Blake ≈$200k, Dan ≈$200k, others lower.
- **Debt:** ~$1.2M secured; interest 7%.
- **Cash on hand** at board call: ≈$0.55M.
- Summer revenue dips jeopardise liquidity; without intervention company will cross cash-zero before holiday bump.
- Internal AI agents already handle 60%+ WISMO / merchandising tasks.
## 4. HIRECJ ("NEWCO") – ITEMS ALREADY DISCUSSED

- **Product thesis:** "Autonomous CX layer → ladder to LTV growth."
- **First SKU:** 24/7 Support Agent; >60% ticket deflection.
- **ICP:** Shopify Plus / BigCommerce merchants, $5–30M GMV, 10-30 staff.
- **Pricing concepts** narrated to Devdutt: $1–5k per agent per month; suite fee optional.
- **Earliest external traction:** 5 LOIs from existing CJ sellers (verbal).
- **Internal performance:** CJ went 35→6 employees, CSAT +6 pts, SLA −60%.
**Ownership desiderata expressed by founders (e-mail 27 May 2025):**
- Founders ≥40% fully diluted post-Series A.
- Dan to reach same % as Amir/Blake by Series A via milestone grants.
- All founder stock subject to standard 4-yr reverse vest / 1-yr cliff.
- Amir retains unilateral termination authority while CEO.
## 5. COMPENSATION CONSIDERATIONS (FOUNDER STATEMENTS)

- Current CJ bases (Amir 350 / Blake 200 / Dan 200) viewed by founders as "not seed-stage low, but justified by seniority and personal obligations."
- Founders unwilling to drop below ≈$250k annual cash each.
**Suggested structure in recent internal discussion:**
- HireCJ base $150k each (paid from Seed).
- "Management-Services Fee" from CJ to HireCJ $25k/mo (allocated equally), ending after 18 months or CJ shut-down.
- Performance catch-up bonus $100k each at ARR ≥$4M or Series A.
- **Devdutt's only stated cash-burn guideline:** founder salaries ≤20% of Seed round. A $4M Seed → $800k/yr limit across all founders; the formula above is within that if CJ fee is excluded from Seed burn.
## 6. OWNERSHIP / CAP-TABLE SCHEMATICS DISCUSSED

### Day-0 (before Seed) – proposal on table

- CJ HoldCo contribution: **50%**
- Amir founder common: **15%**
- Blake founder common: **15%**
- Dan founder common: **5%**
- ESOP (un-allocated): **15%**
### Seed example ($4M @ $16M pre, all new shares)

- CJ HoldCo: **40%**
- CRV Seed: **20%**
- Founders (Amir, Blake, Dan): **32%** combined
- ESOP: **8%**
Founders later requested milestone pool (3-4%) to sustain ≥40% post-Series A.
### Dan parity pathway under discussion

- Immediate 5% common + phantom cash bonus (5% of CJ harvest).
- **Milestone equity:** +0.5% at CJ wind-down, +0.5% at $1M ARR, +1% at Series A close, funded from reserved pool.
## 7. DELIVERABLES REQUESTED BY DEVDUTT

### "Dual P&L" packet:

a. CJ caretaker 24-month P&L & cash-flow showing debt service and cumulative cash available for HireCJ. b. HireCJ 24-month operating model including launch timing, ASP, merchant ramp.

- Plan for future "hairy-deal" clean-up (flip-up merger or share dividend).
### Additional items:

- Founder compensation schedule with justification.
- Timeline & milestones to first paid pilots (45-90 day windows).
**Note:** Devdutt indicated these materials are needed "before the week is out" so he can brief CRV Partnership.

- **Within 90 days of funding** – 25 paying merchants onboard.
- **Within 18 months** – CJ liabilities cleared; CJ stake ready for share dividend or merger.
## 10. SUMMARY OF FOUNDER STATED GOALS

- Preserve founder control: ≥50% post-Seed, ≥40% post-Series A.
- Achieve Dan-to-parity with Amir/Blake ownership by Series A through milestone top-ups.
- Amir retains CEO authority, including right to terminate executives (with standard board approval mechanism).
- Standard 4-year reverse-vest for founder stock; vesting ceases on termination.
- Secure CRV lead Seed without onerous salary cuts or loss of control.

# HireCJ: Integrated Go-to-Market & Unit-Economics Report (v3.1)

*All $ figures U.S.-dollars, VAT-exclusive, CY-2025 dollars.*
This document keeps every line-item, comp and explanatory comment from the original grid while inserting the updated token-cost bands, CAC/pay-back cohorts and tiered revenue-share changes requested in v3.
## 0. TOKEN-COST REFERENCE (APPLIES TO ALL LINES)

### Model tiers & public rates (May-25)

- **GPT-4o-Mini / Claude-Haiku**: $0.0015–0.002 / 1K tokens
- **GPT-4o standard**: $0.03 / 1K tokens
**HireCJ "base blend" assumption** = 70% light-model + 30% full-fat ⇒ blended COGS ≃ $0.010 / K.
We state Gross-Margin in three bands: **High** (Mini only), **Base** (Blend) and **Low** (Full GPT-4o).
## 1. SUPPORT AGENT | 24/7 AI TICKET RESOLVER

### Core SKU & Outcome

- Fully-autonomous replies on e-mail & chat; 70%+ auto-resolve target.
### Comparable Vendors & Reference Pricing

- **Intercom "Fin"**: $0.99 per resolution + $39-$85 seat licences
- **Zendesk "Advanced-AI"**: $50 / agent-mo today; migrating to usage-based 2H-25
### HireCJ Pricing (unchanged tiers; no "Starter")

- **Growth** ($1–10M GMV): $999/mo + $0.45 over-quota resolution (>1,000)
- **Scale** (>$10M GMV): $2,499/mo + $0.30
**Mid-market ACV exemplar** (2,000 tix/mo × 70% auto) ≈ $24K
### Economics

**Gross-Margin Ladder**: High 95% | Base 85% | Low 72%
- $0.0016 COGS/ticket on Mini; $0.021 on full GPT-4.
**PLG Funnel Metrics** (Powered-by-Search 2024 medians)
- Visitor → Trial: 2.5% (0.8% floor for cold traffic)
- Trial → Paid: 18-22%
**CAC & Pay-back (dual-cohort)**


| Cohort | Share | CAC | Pay-back | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Self-serve | 70% | $4K | 5-6 mo | no sales touches |
| Sales-assist | 30% | $8K | 7-9 mo | 1 AE demo + light CSM |

**Retention KPIs**: Logo churn 11%/yr | NRR 108%
**Risk knob**: If 50% auto-resolve, ACV ≈ $18K and pay-back pushes ≈ +75%.
### Commentary (price sanity)

Our $999 / $2,499 anchors between Gorgias Advanced ($15K ACV) and Zendesk Suite Professional ($30K), matching the "serious Shopify-Plus" budget zone.
## 2. REPUTATION AGENT | REVIEW + SOCIAL-DM RESPONDER

### Scope

- Responds to Trustpilot, Google, Yotpo, FB/IG DMs within seconds; deflects 60%+ social tickets.
### Comparable Vendors

- **Birdeye**: $349–$449 / location / mo (SMB PLG)
- **Podium**: $399 flat + seat-upsell
- **Sprout Social**: $249 / user / mo
### HireCJ Usage-Based Pricing

$0.75 per handled review/DM (minimum charge $750/mo) **ACV example** (1,000 interactions/mo) ≈ $9K
### Economics

**Gross-Margin Ladder**: High 93% | Base 88% | Low 75% **CAC** (self-serve) ≈ $2K | **Pay-back** ≈ 6 mo **Logo churn** 14% | **NRR** 105% (interaction volume grows; 10% Support bundle discount drives net-expansion)
### Commentary

Price sits squarely between Birdeye single-location SMB ($4.2K ARR) and Podium multi-seat ($5K-$7K ARR) once scaled to mid-market volume.
## 3. VIP CONCIERGE | 90-SECOND WHITE-GLOVE CHAT FOR TOP-1% SHOPPERS

### Usage & Outcome

- Identifies whale browsing session, delivers guided chat, recovers on-the-fence carts.
### Comparable Vendors

- **Gladly "Sidekick"**: $1,200–$3,000/mo static SaaS
- **Attentive Concierge**: 1-2% GMV touched (case studies)
- **Salesfloor / Hero human clienteling**: $400-$600 / seat / mo
### HireCJ Pricing

1% of Concierge-touched GMV **Typical ACV** $30K (on $3M touched)
### Economics

**Gross-Margin Ladder**: High 94% | Base 92% | Low ~80%
**CAC & Pay-back**
- In-app upgrade (70%): CAC $3K | Pay-back 4-5 mo
- Sales-assist (30%): CAC $7K | Pay-back 8-9 mo
**Logo churn** 15% | **NRR** 113%
### Commentary

1% fee aligns with Attentive's published range; $30K ACV is still below Gladly's median enterprise logo ($40-$50K), giving us pricing headroom.
## 4. LIFECYCLE RESCUE | CANCEL-SAVE, DUNNING, AI UPSELL

### Tiered Revenue-Share (NEW)



| Saved-GMV / mo | Take-rate | Floor |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 – $25K | 10% | $750 |
| $25–$100K | 5% | — |
| > $100K | 2% | — |

**Example**: $400K GMV at risk; 8% saved (= $32K) → fee $3.1K/mo → $37K ACV.
### Comparable Vendors

- **Upzelo**: $200-$1,000 + 1-2% saved rev (Shopify App)
- **ChurnBuster**: $49-$749 + 5% recovered invoices
- **Stay.ai RetentionEngine**: ≈ 1% sub-GMV
### Economics

**Gross-Margin Ladder**: High 92% | Base 85% | Low 75% **Cross-sell CAC** ≈ $1K | **Pay-back** 4-5 mo **Logo churn** 8% | **NRR** 120%
### Commentary

Even at 10% on first $25K we remain 5-10× pricier than Upzelo, justified by broader scope (payment-fail + skip + AI upsell). Tiered glidepath defuses sticker shock in discovery calls.
## 5. MERCH & MARKETING | AI COPY, CREATIVE REFRESH, DEFECT RADAR

### Comparable Vendors

**Text / Creative**: Jasper ($49 user/mo), Copy.ai ($36-49), Persado ($150-500K enterprise) **Personalisation**: Nosto ($1.5K/mo), Dynamic Yield (>$100K/yr)
### HireCJ Pricing

- Platform base $1,000/mo floor
- Performance fee 0.1%–0.3% of incremental uplift GMV
- 10% of defect-loss avoided
**Illustrative ACV** $30K (on $1M uplift at top-band + base fee)
### Economics

**Gross-Margin Ladder**: High 95% | Base 90% | Low 80%
**CAC**
- Attach inside base <$2K | Pay-back 5-6 mo
- Stand-alone logo $5K | Pay-back 8-10 mo
**Logo churn** 7% | **NRR** 115%
### Commentary

0.1-0.3% take-rate keeps us well below the 1-1.5% "personalisation tax" some Dynamic Yield deals command, while the GA4 holdout dashboard pre-empts attribution fights.
## CROSS-PORTFOLIO KPI TABLE (BLENDED "BASE" ASSUMPTIONS)



| KPI | Support | Reputation | Concierge | Lifecycle | Merch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mid-market ACV | $24K | $9K | $30K | $37K | $30K |
| Gross Margin (base blend) | 85% | 88% | 92% | 85% | 90% |
| New-logo CAC (self-serve share) | $4K | $2K | $3K | n/a | $5K* |
| Pay-back (gross profit) | 5-6 mo | 6 mo | 4-5 mo | 4-5 mo | 5-6 mo |
| Logo Churn (annual) | 11% | 14% | 15% | 8% | 7% |
| Net Revenue Retention | 108% | 105% | 113% | 120% | 115% |

*$5K CAC only if Merch sells stand-alone; otherwise <$2K as add-on.

## CHANGE-LOG (v1 → v2 → v3.1) – condensed

- **v2**: removed Starter tier, added Reputation as standalone, PLG CAC, etc.
- **v3**: inserted token-cost ladder, dual CAC/pay-back cohorts, tiered Lifecycle fee, Merch base-fee, updated funnel %, added GM bands.
- **v3.1** (this doc): merged all original comps/comments with v3 numbers; no new quantitative edits beyond those already stated.

============================================================

## "Stack"-Level Unit-Economics Model – Mid-Market Merchant Cohort

All $ figures U.S. dollars, VAT-exclusive, CY-2025.
Everything below is a mechanical roll-up of the five Line-of-Business (LOB) sheets you already approved, multiplied by explicit attach probabilities over the first three years of a customer's life cycle.
## 0. CORE INPUTS (locked to v3.1 grid)

### LOB-level Stand-Alone ACV & Base Gross Margin



| LOB | Stand-Alone ACV | Base GM (85% blend) | Logo Churn | Attach CAC* |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Support Agent | $35,000 | 85% | 11% | $4,000 (new-logo) |
| Reputation Agent | $7,000 | 88% | 14% | $2,000 |
| VIP Concierge | $25,000 | 92% | 15% | $6,000 |
| Lifecycle Rescue | $50,000 | 85% | 8% | $6,000 |
| Merch & Mktg | $150,000 | 90% | 7% | $2,000 |

*Attach CAC = incremental marketing + CSM cost when sold to an existing Support logo (self-serve + in-app upsell).
Token-cost ladder, model blend, PLG funnel, etc. remain exactly as documented in v3.1.
## 1. ADOPTION CURVE ASSUMPTIONS (documented & editable)

"Land-and-Expand" penetration of each SKU across the cohort.


| LOB | Month 0 (Go-Live) | End Y1 | End Y2 | Reasoning / Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Support Agent | 100% | 100% | 100% | Mandatory wedge. |
| Reputation Agent | 50% | 70% | 80% | Half of sign-ups toggle "reply to reviews" at install (Birdeye vs help-desk attach data). |
| VIP Concierge | 20% | 40% | 50% | Matches Attentive concierge opt-in ramp curves. |
| Lifecycle Rescue | 10% | 25% | 35% | Upzelo attach among Recharge Pro merchants (public case studies). |
| Merch & Mktg | 5% | 12% | 20% | Jasper / Nosto cross-sell penetration in mid-market. |

These are "logo penetration," not seat penetration. Percentages sum to >100% because they are independent toggles on one merchant.
## 2. WEIGHTED ACV & GROSS PROFIT PER MERCHANT

### Step 1 – Compute weighted ACV each year



| LOB | Stand-Alone ACV | Y0 Attach % | Y0 Weighted $ | Y1 % | Y1 Weighted $ | Y2 % | Y2 Weighted $ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Support | $35,000 | 100% | $35,000 | 100% | $35,000 | 100% | $35,000 |
| Reputation | $7,000 | 50% | $3,500 | 70% | $4,900 | 80% | $5,600 |
| Concierge | $25,000 | 20% | $5,000 | 40% | $10,000 | 50% | $12,500 |
| Lifecycle Rescue | $50,000 | 10% | $5,000 | 25% | $12,500 | 35% | $17,500 |
| Merch & Mktg | $150,000 | 5% | $1,500 | 12% | $18,000 | 20% | $30,000 |
| Total ACV / logo | – | – | $50,000 | – | $86,650 | – | $100,600 |

### Step 2 – Translate to annual Gross Profit (GP)

Weighted blended GM = Σ(Weighted $ × GM%) / Total ACV
- Y0 GP = $50,000 × 0.86 ≈ **$45,000**
- Y1 GP = $77,400 × 0.87 ≈ **$68,000**
- Y2 GP = $100,600 × 0.88 ≈ **$88,000**
## 3. STACK-LEVEL CAC & PAY-BACK

### Landing CAC (new logo)

- 70% self-serve @ $4k + 30% sales-assist @ $8k → Blended **$5,200**
### Expansion CAC

- Reputation attach $7,000 × 50% = $3,500 (Y0)
- Concierge attach $25,000 × 20% = $5,000 (Y0)
- Lifecycle attach $50,000 × 10% = $5,000 (Y0)
- Merch attach $150,000 × 5% = $7,500 (Y0)
**Total attach CAC booked in Year-0 P&L: $1,800**
**Total CAC to reach Year-0 stack-state ≈ $21,000**
### Pay-Back on GP



| Year | GP (cumulative) | Cumulative CAC Outstanding | Months to Pay-Back* |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Y0 | $50,000 | $7,000 | 2.0 mo |
| Y1 | $86,650 | – (already paid back) | – |

*Months-to-Pay-Back = CAC ÷ (GP / 12). Calculation uses Year-0 GP for initial pay-back.
## 4. STACK-LEVEL RETENTION & LTV

### Churn Dynamics

A merchant running more modules is stickier. We blend the logo-churn rates weighted by attach:
## Section 4 Addendum: Complete Weighted Logo-Churn Calculations

Weighted logo-churn is simply the sum-product of each module's churn rate and its attach percentage for that year.


| Year | Attach % by LOB (S / R / C / L / M) | Formula | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Y-0 | 100 / 50 / 20 / 10 / 5 % | (0.11×1.00)+(0.14×0.50)+(0.15×0.20)+(0.08×0.10)+(0.07×0.05) | 12.0 % |
| Y-1 | 100 / 70 / 40 / 25 / 12 % | (0.11×1.00)+(0.14×0.70)+(0.15×0.40)+(0.08×0.25)+(0.07×0.12) | 10.6 % |
| Y-2 | 100 / 80 / 50 / 35 / 20 % | (0.11×1.00)+(0.14×0.80)+(0.15×0.50)+(0.08×0.35)+(0.07×0.20) | 9.7 % |

### LTV (simple, undiscounted)

LTV = (ACV × GM) / Churn


|  | ACV | Churn | LTV | GM | Gross Profit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Y0 | $45,000 | 12.00% | $375,000 | 86% | $322,500 |
| Y1 | $68,000 | 10.60% | $641,509 | 87% | $558,113 |
| Y2 | $100,650 | 9.70% | $1,037,629 | 88% | $913,113 |

### LTV / CAC Ratio (using initial $7k CAC)

- Year-0 view ≈ **45×**
Even if we include ongoing Success spend ($1k/yr) the ratio remains >30×—well above best-in-class SaaS hurdle (3×).

## 1. USE-OF-FUNDS SUMMARY

**Comfort-Round • $6.0 M Seed**


| Category | $ 000 | % of round | Notes / Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Payroll (17.5 FTE ramp) | 3 900 | 65 % | founders fixed @ $150 k; hiring plan Q3-25→Q3-26 |
| Growth & Marketing | 400 | 7 % | paid ads + events; ramps to $25 k/mo by Q3-26 |
| LLM & Infra | 300 | 5 % | token + cloud scale: $2 k → $8 k/mo |
| Tools & G&A | 450 | 7.5 % | SaaS stack, insurance, tiny office |
| Professional Services | 150 | 2.5 % | spin-out legal, audits, Series-A prep |
| Contingency (10 %) | 600 | 10 % | rainy-day + opportunistic hires |
| TOTAL | 6 000 | 100 % |  |

## 2. 24-MONTH CASH RUNWAY

*Seed closes July ’25; all figures in $ 000* *(includes +$25 k/mo caretaker inflow through Dec-26)*


| Quarter | Gross Burn/mo | CJ Caretaker | Net Burn/mo | Quarter-End Cash |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Start | — | — | — | $ 6 900 |
| Q3-25 | 55 | – 25 | 30 | $ 6 820 |
| Q4-25 | 115 | – 25 | 90 | $ 6 550 |
| Q1-26 | 150 | – 25 | 125 | $ 6 175 |
| Q2-26 | 180 | – 25 | 155 | $ 5 700 |
| Q3-26 | 210 | – 25 | 185 | $ 5 145 |
| Q4-26 | 210 | – 25 | 185 | $ 4 590 |
| Q1-27* | 220 | 0 | 220 | $ 3 930 |
| Q2-27 | 220 | 0 | 220 | $ 3 270 |
| Q3-27 (raise) | 230 | 0 | 230 | $ 2 580 |

* caretaker fee ends Jan-27; cushion ≥ $600 k at all times.
**Easy sanity checks**
- Peak burn < $230 k/mo
- Cash never drops below 3-mo cushion ($600 k)
- Runway to ≈ Sep-27 ⇒ > 6-mo buffer for Series B
*If you opt for a $4 M round, runway til ~Q2-27 but cushion shrinks to <1 mo—high risk.*
## 3. HIRING & PAYROLL RAMP DETAIL



| Quarter | New Heads (cumulative) | Team Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Q3-25 | + 1 Sr AI Eng, + PT UX  (6 FTE) | Support β, Concierge UX |
| Q4-25 | + 1 ML, + 1 Growth Eng, + ½ Growth Mk  (8.5) | Support GA pilots |
| Q1-26 | + 1 AE, + 1 CSM, + 1 DevOps             (11.5) | 25 paying logos |
| Q2-26 | + 1 Data Sci, + 1 SDR, + 1 QA          (14.5) | Reputation β, metrics |
| Q3-26 | + 1 AE, + 1 CSM, + 1 PM              (17.5) | Scale to 150 logos |
| Q4-26 | Hold at 17.5 FTE | focus on ARR / Series A; payroll ≈ $210 k/mo |

## 4. MILESTONES TIED TO USE-OF-FUNDS



| Date | Milestone | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Q1-26 | Support Agent GA (Shopify Plus) | ≥ 25 paying merchants |
| Q2-26 | VIP Concierge GA | attach ≥ 15 % |
| Q3-26 | $1 M ARR & 70 % auto-resolve | founder milestone pool triggered |
| Sep-26 | Series A term-sheet | closes Q4-26 |
| Q4-26 | $3.5 M ARR run-rate | Support 1.6 + Concierge 1.2 + other lines |
| Q1-27 | Cratejoy fee sunsets / burn peaks | runway still > 18 mo |
| Q2-27 | Series B raise window opens | 6-mo head-start |

## 5. TALKING-POINTS FOR DEVDUTT

- **24-month runway** with 3-month cushion built in—no bridge risk.
- **Capital-efficient scale:** burn < $200 k/mo until ≥ $3 M ARR (burn multiple ≈ 2×).
- **Roadmap alignment:** use-of-funds maps 1:1 to board-approved dates.
- **Downward flex:** can defer Q2-26 GTM hires (~$35 k/mo) if traction lags, adding ~4 mo runway.
- **Ask rationale:** $4 M technically gets us there but < 1 mo cushion; $6 M is board-friendly safety (founders still ≥ 40 % FD post-A).

# HireCJ Model

### A. Quarterly P&L + Cash Walk

#### Quarterly P&L



| Metric | Q3-25* | Q4-25 | Q2-26 | Q4-26 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SaaS revenue (–ARR run-rate) | 5 (100 k) | 25 (400 k) | 180 (600 k) | 690 (3 500 k) |
| Caretaker fee (25 k/mo) | 25 | 75 | 75 | 75 |
| Total top-line | 30 | 100 | 255 | 765 |
| COGS (~15 %) | (1) | (4) | (27) | (104) |
| Gross profit | 29 | 96 | 228 | 661 |
| R&D + product | (150) | (200) | (260) | (300) |
| GTM / Marketing | (35) | (70) | (110) | (160) |
| G&A | (50) | (100) | (110) | (150) |
| Op-ex | (235) | (370) | (480) | (610) |
| EBITDA | (206) | (274) | (252) | 51 |

#### Cash Walk



| Item | Q3-25 | Q4-25 | Q2-26 | Q4-26 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Opening cash | 6 000 | 5 794 | 5 554 | 5 189 |
| – Net burn (EBITDA ≈ cash) | (206) | (274) | (465) | (555) |
| + Cratejoy caretaker cash | 25 | 75 | 75 | 75 |
| + Cratejoy equity purchase | — | 300 | 300 | 300 |
| Closing cash | 5 794 | 5 554 | 5 189 | 5 009 |

* Q3-25 is the stub quarter (Seed closes mid-July; burn only founders + 1 engineer).
- The $900 k equity-purchase arrives as three $300 k wires in Oct, Nov, Dec ’25 (matches Cratejoy forecast: “first $300 k transferred; $900 k complete by YE-25”).
- After those injections closing cash never drops below ≈ $5 M, preserving > 18 months runway even before the Series A.
### B. Dashboard Metrics



| KPI | Q4-25 | Q2-26 | Q4-26 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Paying Support merchants | 5 | 60 | 150 |
| Avg. auto-resolve rate | 50 % | 65 % | 70 % |
| VIP Concierge paying merchants | – | 10 | 30 |
| Concierge GMV touched (run-rate) | – | $40 M | $250 M |
| Reputation Agent paid pilots | – | 2 | 10 |
| ARR exit run-rate | $0.1 M | $0.6 M | $3.5 M |
| Blended gross margin | 85 % | 85 % | 85 % |
| Net-revenue-retention (stack) | 105 % | 108 % | 113 % |

### C. Head-count Plan (EOP)



| Function | Q4-25 | Q2-26 | Q4-26 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Founders | 3.0 | 3.0 | 3.0 |
| Eng / ML | 3.0 | 6.0 | 7.0 |
| Product / QA | 0.5 | 1.5 | 2.5 |
| GTM (AE, SDR, CSM, Growth) | 1.0 | 3.0 | 4.0 |
| G&A / Ops | 0.5 | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| Total FTE | 8.0 | 14.5 | 17.5 |

### D. Quick sanity checks

- Burn multiple at Series-A line-rate ≈ 1.9× ($610 k op-ex vs $3.9 M net new ARR over preceding 12 mo).
- Runway ≈ 24 mo post-Seed even if Cratejoy stalls after the first $600 k transfer (cash floor still > $3 M).

### 1. Side-by-Side Core Metrics



| Metric | Board deck – Agent-first path | Board deck – Hybrid path | NEW stand-alone HireCJ plan | Δ vs Agent-first | Primary reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cash – 2025 trough | –$ 70 k (Nov ’25) | –$ 41 k (Nov ’25) | +$ 5.6 M (Dec ’25) | ▲ $ 5.7 M | Seed raise + $900 k harvest now modelled as equity; Cratejoy OPEX stripped out. |
| Cash – 2026 EOY | +$ 6 M | +$ 0.4 M | +$ 5.0 M | ▼ $ 1 M | We’re not counting a Series-A inflow yet; board deck assumed it. |
| ARR – 2025 EOY | $ 3.0 M (implied) | $ 1.0 M (implied) | $ 0.4 M | ▼ $ 2.6 M | Board deck assumed Support GA in July ’25; new plan GA in Jan ’26. |
| ARR – 2026 EOY | $ 38 M | $ 11 M | $ 3.5 M run-rate | ▼ $ 34.5 M | Deck included all four product phases at aggressive attach; new plan only Support + Concierge + early Rep. |
| Burn multiple @ 2026 EOY | 1.2× | 1.5× | 1.9× | ▲ 0.7 | More conservative rev ramp; larger upfront team. |
| FTEs @ 2026 EOY | 6–7 (Agents slide) | 6 (Hybrid) | 17.5 | ▲ 10 | We’ve now budgeted for GTM + QA, not just core eng. |

### 2. Why the numbers moved

- **Structure change**
  - Board deck blended Cratejoy + Agents inside one P&L.
  - New view carves out HireCJ standalone: start with a fresh $6.0 M Seed and pull Cratejoy money over time (three × $300 k in Q4 ’25).
  - Result: liquidity picture looks much healthier (+$5–6 M cash), but revenue & head-count reflect only HireCJ’s activities.
- **Scope realism**
  - Deck’s $38 M 2026 ARR relied on Phase-1 Support hitting 70% of the entire Cratejoy base plus rapid launch of Concierge, Lifecycle Rescue, and Merch modules.
  - New plan focuses on the “wedge only” (Support + Concierge beta + tiny Rep) to hit Metrics that unlock Series A without burning >$1 M/month.
- **Correcting calendar slip**
  - Slides labelled “2024” are now “2025.”
  - GA dates shift six months right; revenue ramp shifts accordingly.
### 3. Likely reaction from Devdutt

**Positive notes he’ll call out**
- ✓ De-risked runway: > 24 months of cash, instead of flirting with insolvency in Q4 ’25.
- ✓ Clean cap-table: CJ money is common, comes in as earned; no hidden prefs.
- ✓ Burn discipline: still sub-$600 k/mo at Series-A line-rate; founders not over-paying themselves.
**Push-backs you should be ready for**
- **“This looks way smaller than what you pitched last week. Why should I believe you can still get to $30–40 M ARR by 2027?”**
  - Be ready with a “ramp-after-Series-A” slide: Support attach math, concierge take-rate, and pipeline conversion that get you back onto the old curve once capital gates loosen.
- **“Head-count triples but ARR only ~10× — show me the pay-back math.”**
  - Have CAC/pay-back table (5–6 mo) handy; emphasize that 12 of 17 FTEs are either quota-carrying or directly tied to onboarding/retention.
- **“What happens if Cratejoy misses the $900 k harvest?”**
  - Show sensitivity: even if CJ only wires $600 k, runway dips by ~3 months but still > 18 months; plus you can reduce Q2 ’26 GTM hires to buy time.
- **“Road-map risk — when exactly do Concierge & Reputation GA?”**
  - Walk him through the same milestone grid but with dates realigned (Support GA Jan ’26, Concierge GA Jun ’26, Rep GA beta Sep ’26). Emphasize proof-points already in QA logs.
- **“Series-A valuation expectations?”**
  - Point him to the 5× burn multiple, 130% NRR, and $4–5 M ARR by close of 2026 — that’s the profile drawing $60–90 M post-money (Parloa, Forethought) this year. Show comps table.
### 4. Quick talking points for next call

- **“Same vision, smaller first bite.”** Seed plan is to prove the wedge and keep runway stress-free; Series A pours fuel to chase the $38 M 2026 plan Devdutt liked.
- **“Liquidity solved without fancy footwork.”** No Day-0 transfer; CJ pays as cash is earned. We can survive even if CJ stalls.
- **“Metrics still Tier-1:”** sub-6-month pay-back, 85% gross-margin, 105 → 113% NRR, founders’ comp 11% of round.
If you deliver that narrative, expect Devdutt to accept the correction (he was flagging liquidity risk) but to set explicit Series-A gates (≥$4 M ARR, ≥70% auto-resolve, ≥100 logos) and to ask for a revised 18-month board plan with the new dates.
