LightRAG Document Ingestion Test File
=====================================

This is a sample text file for testing the document ingestion capabilities of the LightRAG system.

Key Features:
- Vector embeddings for semantic search
- Knowledge graph construction for relationships
- Multi-modal query support (naive, local, global, hybrid)
- Namespace isolation for multi-tenant deployments

Test Content:
The LightRAG system processes documents by first chunking them into meaningful segments, 
then generating embeddings for semantic understanding. These embeddings are stored in a 
vector database for efficient similarity search. Simultaneously, the system extracts 
entities and relationships to build a knowledge graph that captures the document's 
structural information.

This dual approach allows for both semantic similarity search and graph-based 
relationship queries, providing comprehensive knowledge retrieval capabilities.
