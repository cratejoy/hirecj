# Phase 2.5: RSS Podcast Transcription Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Core Implementation
- Created `audio_utils.py` for audio processing utilities (chunking, duration, validation)
- Created `podcast_ingester.py` with full RSS/podcast processing logic
- Added podcast command to Knowledge CLI (`knowledge.py`)
- Integrated with existing Knowledge API for document upload

### 2. Features Implemented
- RSS feed parsing with feedparser
- Audio download with progress tracking
- Audio chunking for Whisper API (25MB limit)
- OpenAI Whisper API integration for transcription
- Episode deduplication using SHA-256 hashes
- Local state management in ~/.knowledge/podcast_state/
- YouTube video support (bonus feature)
- Metadata preservation (title, date, description, duration)

### 3. Documentation
- Updated README_CLI.md with podcast command documentation
- Added requirements section for OpenAI API key and ffmpeg
- Included example workflows for podcast ingestion
- Updated Makefile with knowledge-podcast command

### 4. CLI Usage
```bash
# Basic RSS feed ingestion
./knowledge.py podcast https://feeds.simplecast.com/54nAGcIl -n podcasts

# With options
./knowledge.py podcast <RSS_URL> -n <namespace> --limit 5 --keep-audio

# YouTube video
./knowledge.py podcast https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID -n videos
```

## Key Design Decisions
1. Client-side processing (requires OpenAI API key locally)
2. Stateful processing with local tracking to avoid re-processing
3. Automatic namespace creation if needed
4. Audio files cleaned up by default (--keep-audio to retain)
5. Non-blocking upload to Knowledge API

## Dependencies Added
- feedparser==6.0.10 (RSS parsing)
- pydub==0.25.1 (Audio manipulation)
- yt-dlp==2024.3.10 (YouTube download)
- openai==1.35.13 (Whisper API)
- python-dotenv==1.0.1 (Environment variables)

## Next Steps
- Test with actual OpenAI API key
- Monitor performance with large podcasts
- Consider adding batch processing for multiple RSS feeds
- Add support for resuming interrupted processing
