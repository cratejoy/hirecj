So here's what you're about to learn So first of all, you're going to learn why emails are the best way to reach 10k a month You're going to learn a little bit about email automations and email sequences Then we're going to go over some email structures that you can use to write converting copy Okay, so all emails are structured You're not just going to be sitting there looking at a blank page and trying to figure out what to write No, i'm going to show you exactly what to write and how to write it Okay, i'll also be going over how to write multiple types of email sequences The ins and outs of emails that sell and of course how to perfect your email copywriting strategy and where to go from here Guys, this one is going to be a banger.

You're like, okay Yeah, that was good. I felt good about writing that like no this is Literally designed to get you results as fast as possible Okay, so in order to do that, you must follow these steps first of all save this video for later by leaving like Reason being is because it's going to be a long one. I'm not gonna lie It's gonna be a long way. It's not gonna be no little seven minute. No 20 minute video This is going to be a colossal video. Okay, because I got a lot of stuff to cover with you guys We're going to be doing a complete master class and i'm going to be speaking with you as if you are a complete beginner Okay, i'm going to leave nothing out. So It's okay to leave this video and come back to it But if you're going to do that leave a like so that you can find it later because you can go into youtube Go look at your liked videos and it will be right there for you to pick up where you left off next up You're going to want to follow every single step throughout here I'm going to be giving you action steps that you're going to have to follow next up ask any questions in the comments I'm just going to be 100% honest if you don't have questions by the end of this Then I don't know if you were really paying attention. Okay? The thing is that we're going to be covering so much that you're going to have a lot of answers But those answers are going to lead you to a lot of questions Okay, because right now you don't know what you don't know But when you go through this you're going to learn a lot But then you're going to understand what you don't know. So you're going to have questions naturally This is how it's going to go next up. You're going to want to take notes and watch certain parts again Like I said, we're going over a lot and although i'm going to be going over things as if you are a beginner You can already tell that I ain't going to be sitting here belaboring the points We're droning on and on and on about the same thing. Like no I move quick We do things quick over here business is about speed. We got to get it So make sure you take notes and watch certain parts again If you were confused or if you're stuck and you don't know what to do just come back watch certain parts again And of course we are moving on guys part one Okay, we got to understand the goal of emails because a lot of people get this wrong First of all, the goal of emails is not to sell but to make money I know it doesn't really sound like that makes too much sense But we're gonna it's gonna make so much sense to you as we go through this next up value 80 promo 20 one of the biggest objections that I hear when people Get the idea of email copywriting. Is there a way they're like, wait, I don't get it I don't actually buy anything from my email all the time when I get those promotion spammy emails that are selling to me I always put them in the trash exactly Exactly. That's why it works. That's why it works So imagine if you were just extremely Into I don't know playing playing piano. You were you were really trying to learn piano piano was basically all you did all day You're just trying to master piano at any and all costs and You have this really cool pianist that you really like maybe they have a youtube channel or maybe they just post on instagram or whatever And you're on their email list You're gonna open up those emails why because they give you helpful tips tactics strategies to master piano Let's say whether it is entertaining or whatever. You're gonna open those all the time. So let's say 20. That's one of every Sorry. Yeah, it's one of every five Goes ahead and sells to you or leaves a link at the bottom that says by the way I have this full in-depth program step by step on how to do this xyz If you want to get into it, all you got to do is go here And then those people buy And that is how we do it. That is how emails make money. We're not selling people Junk, we're not spamming them. Nothing like that Okay, it's literally mostly value a little bit of promo and the promo is not even hard selling It's literally just by the way, here's a link. It's just as much as that, right? So first of all first misconception, you know myth busted. Let's keep going So Guys emails are considered the powerhouse of marketing campaigns. I want you guys to understand this so When it comes to emails, right you need to understand just how effective they can be. So I have a photo here We need to understand now email marketing on average Okay, and this number varies between 36 and like 42 i've heard as well, right? So between 36 and 42 so 3600 percent return on investment. What does that mean? That means for every dollar that a business typically spends on email marketing They get 36 dollars in return Let's extrapolate that you spend a thousand dollars on email marketing you get thirty six thousand dollars back Ten thousand dollars on email marketing you get three hundred and sixty thousand dollars back Do you understand why selling an email for two hundred and three hundred dollars literally is nothing is literally nothing to these companies And that is so much more than things like search engine optimization Or things like pay per click or things like paid social media guys paid social media is literally 95 Return on ad spend you understand that guys You see instagram ads and facebook ads and youtube ads all of the time You see them everywhere all the time But understand that those are not nearly nearly nearly as effective as email marketing and let me tell you why you see when it comes to the world of advertisements There's only a limited supply There's only a limited supply of users on all of these platforms meaning that the more people who use ads the higher It costs to run ads, okay They're just going to go higher and higher and higher and ads are going to be harder and harder and harder to become profitable But my friends email marketing will always stay the same So yes, as you can see clearly by the data email marketing it's in high demand right now But it's only going to get higher my friends The opportunity is endless. We'll just leave it at that opportunity is endless Moving on Why? Why do emails dominate we know that emails dominate but here are here's why emails dominate dominate First of all, they are set it and forget it an email automation or sequence can be set in place to send automatically when someone enters the email list and can Be automatically updated based on the actions. They take example Let's say somebody joins a list right joins your email list You don't have to email them manually or send it manually You could have it send automatically one day after somebody buys this product send them another email right and let's say just Example that that first email you send them is oh, by the way, here's another product Now you just upsold that person you told you turned one sale into two by doing literally And I don't think you really understand this literally nothing You wrote the email you put it in the sequence you left it alone Now every single person who buys gets an upsell day after they buy This is how it works. This is why it's so So effective this is why charging 200 for one email that you can use again and again and again and again and again is literally astronomically low Okay Like I said one of the best ways to start generating wealth is to charge rich people and find problems with them solve those problems Right charge them an amount of money. That's a lot to you, but not a lot to them And that's how you get started Next up you can make them highly targeted. You're able to tailor your emails On the subscribers actions How they got your email and even if they've opened or clicked the links or not So let's say you send somebody an email for a product they click the link, but they don't buy You can message them again saying hey, I see that you checked out my product You wanted to buy it But you didn't actually follow through was there a reason and sometimes people will be like yeah, actually um, I was looking at it and my card wasn't working and then maybe you can fix their card information or give them an Different type of checkout or something You can just basically remind people. Yo, you were about to buy and then a lot of times people will just be like Oh, yeah, I was about to buy or maybe they got distracted. Maybe something happened So they'll call them back And they'll buy because you simply sent them an email automation that again is set it and forget it Okay, next up it is easy to build trust with your subscribers through an email list guys People won't choose to buy from you until they know like and trust you Okay, you don't buy from randoms usually You can build a relationship with your email subscribers by giving them value up front and then offering them products later In marketing this is known as warming up leads Okay So when somebody subscribes to your email list And you just start spamming them with links and telling them to buy here buy now go here do that People obviously are not going to like that. So what you want to do is build trust up front How do you do that? Well, like I said going back to the piano example you say, okay, here's some here's some tips Here's top 10 tips on whatever how to play piano better and then that people get that value. They say yes. Thank you I appreciate that they build that know like and trust factor and then what happens Then you keep sending them more value and more value just like that and then every once in a while you say hey Here's some more value. By the way. I do have a product if you want to get whole library full of value And that's going to convert a lot of people because they have that know like and trust factor Now you're not a stranger anymore. People don't usually like to buy from strangers, but your favorite youtuber Sure. I mean you've gotten you've already gotten so much value from all of their videos. They've already taught you how to start Playing piano so it wouldn't be a crazy idea to buy something from them Purely out of just the feeling of reciprocity. You want to do something nice back Next up Why emails are the best way to reach 10k a month? Emails are so powerful And business owners like they really cannot be bothered to write write emails and set up automations And this basically poses a huge opportunity for email copywriters guys Usually right clients for people who are entrepreneurs or have their own business, maybe they're doing something like real estate or maybe they're doing something like credit repair. It's not really that reasonable to think that these people are gonna be super techie and want to do the email automation and blah blah blah. I'll tell you right now a lot of people who are in business, the first thing that they do when it comes to a task is they love to outsource it. They would just rather not do it. So all I got to do is outsource it to you, you show them that you can make the money and boom it's done. When writing something like a sales page, the problem is that it's a one-time project that you won't be required to work consistently. So copywriters sometimes can go in and write somebody a sales page. Like boom here's your sales page. Well they're not gonna need a sales page every week or need a sales page every month. But with emails, what you can do is send a daily email to your list. Set up the automations, set up the things in place so that they're all done and you can start sending daily emails. So now you have a whole pile of emails you can choose from for where you want to put them in the automations, where you want to put them in sequences, everything of that nature. Next up, with email copywriting, it's an ongoing process to write the best emails and set up automations to optimize every campaign like I just discussed. This means you're able to close retainer deals, meaning ongoing, and bring in 2 to 4k every single month from just one client. Close three of these clients and you can make a steady 10k a month from writing emails. Guys, all it takes is maybe writing two emails a day. How long do you think it would realistically take you to write two emails a day? I don't know, an hour, two hours maximum if you're like really going hard at these emails. And like I said, let's say both of these emails you sell them for $200 each like I did in that last deal that I showed you guys. $200 is $400 a day. $400 a day, at the end of a month, 30 days, if my math is not correct, my math is not incorrect, what is that? $12,000 a month. This is why I don't do math in public, but it's a lot of money, okay? You can make a lot of money, clearly, right? As I've just showed you. Guys, like I said, if you want to make a lot of money quick, solve problems for rich people. Charge them what's a lot of money to you, but not a lot of money to them. This is how you start. This is the best way to start a service-based business. Anyways, as we keep going. Part three, we're going to be breaking down emails. This one's gonna be good. This is gonna be good. So, the email that we're about to break down, there's a couple things, right? There's a couple reasons why we're doing this. So, first of all, this is proof that even big creators don't have good copywriting or marketing, okay? The guy that I'm about to show you is not a small entrepreneur, right? He's rather quite popular, but his copywriting and marketing, as we're about to look at, is not very good. Next up, it's easy to improve copywriting, especially with AI, which is what I'm about to show you. So, I went in, made a few tweaks to this guy's email by myself. I actually didn't use AI in this particular instance. I have a whole nother free course on my channel on how to copyright with AI. Anyways, we're gonna talk about that later, okay? Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Next up, this email indirectly makes thousands of dollars every single month, okay? Because this is one in his automation. So, I'm gonna go in here and look at it. So, as we can see here, this email is from Fitxfearless, okay? And, of course, it was improved by me. I made some tweaks, and I'll show you exactly where I did that. This guy, you probably can't see it very well, but this guy is literally, how many subscribers? 308,000 subscribers. So, this is not a small dude, right? This dude does not have a small channel. So, let's look at it. The subject line is, why dating apps don't work for you? Why dating apps don't work for you, okay? So, why would somebody open this? Obviously, because there's somebody who wants to get in a relationship or wants to get girls or whatever. Basically, this dude is a dating coach or whatever, right? So, now he's gonna tell you why dating apps don't work for you. And, of course, that is value. He's leading with value. He's leading with, you're gonna get a benefit from reading this, because after you read this, you're gonna understand why they don't work for you. So, it starts out like this. Dating apps don't work. This is the kind of BS I hear on the daily for men, okay? And I've annotated over here, right? I've put some, we'll go over the annotations later, but dating apps don't work. This is the kind of BS I hear on the daily for men, but what they really need to say is, dating apps don't work for me when I tried it. But we all know that there are guys killing it with dating apps, my students included. And the convenience is unmatched. Yes, you should still learn to cold approach and talk to women, but if you're genuinely busy accomplishing your goals and you still want women in your life, then you're not going to be able to cold approach every week, which is why you need to master online dating. And if you're getting almost no matches, not matching with the quality of women you truly want, or you can't get girls to meet up in person, then I promise you there's something you can do to fix that. Don't blame the algorithm, don't blame the apps, and don't blame the state of women today. It's you. But the good news is that if you're the problem, that means that you're the solution. But now you're probably wondering, well, how do I fix this problem so I can start getting results on dating apps? Well, I wrote an e-book with my seven cheat codes for getting better results with online dating, and I want you to have it for free. Just click the link below to get instant access. So there's a couple things that we should go over here. Note that we're gonna go really, really deep into how to write these emails, but I first wanted to show them to you so that you can better conceptualize what I'm talking about when I go through the points one by one. So the structure here is basically, all the structures have like an acronym. This one is DIC, basically stands for disrupt. So disrupt is something that grabs somebody's attention. Next is intrigue. Intrigue is something that is gonna make people want to keep reading. And then click, or CTA, basically telling somebody click here, go here, do this, do that. So obviously the intrigue here is that dating apps actually do work, but they don't work for you because you haven't been using them right. But it's really important to use these dating apps because if you're somebody working on your goals, they're the most time and energy efficient way to, I don't know, get dates. Therefore, if you want to learn how to do that, or if you're having any of these problems, then you should download my free book. Now, a couple other questions that we need to answer here. Why is he giving it away for free? I thought we were supposed to be making money here. Good catch. Well, there's a couple, okay, so listen up. Maybe take some notes, okay, because I don't know, this might blow your mind. It blew my mind when I learned it. So, a couple things. First of all, this is called training the subscriber to click, right. This is getting them used to clicking. Links on the internet, you know, we all, we all have heard those people who have like clicked on a link, all of a sudden their Instagram is hacked, and they got some freak in their Instagram DMs, and it's just something that they don't want to happen, or their computer gets bricked because they download a virus, or they get some sort of malware, okay. So, by giving them this link and being like, you know, it's free, blah, blah, blah, people now get used to clicking the link. They're trained to click. They're like, okay, well clicking on this dude's link is not going to destroy my computer, so I might as well do it more often, right. So, first of all, you're just getting that out of the way. You're training them to click. That's the first thing. Second of all, is that this is the top of a funnel. We're not really gonna get into funnels today, but I'll give you basically the shortened version rundown. You go here and you download the free resource. After you download the free resource, it takes you automatically to a, I don't know, course or a different e-book that isn't free, right. So, you get the free e-book, but then it also says, hey, by the way, this other e-book is here and it's not free. I think it's like 97 bucks, and then you go there and then people have the option to buy. So, this email, as you can see, it looks completely innocuous. There's nothing selling in here. There's no salesy stuff, nothing, right. In fact, it even offers you some more free value at the bottom, but you can be assured that although this email doesn't sell, it makes money. Now you guys understand what I'm talking about. So, that's just one email that we're gonna go over, but there are some more, okay. But first, we need to talk about email structure. Now, you guys already had a little bit of a preview to DIC, disrupt, intrigue, and click. We already went through that. Next up is PAS. We go over, we start with the problem slash pain. We go over the agitate and then we talk about the solution. And next up, we have HSO. This is hook, then story, then offer. And next up, we have one that I've never even revealed before, although it's pretty simple. It's called the listicle email, okay. All right. This is basically a list of valuable points. For example, three tips to get more clients. It's listicle. You have one, do this, blah, blah, blah, blah. Two, do this, blah, blah, blah, blah. And of course, we're going to be looking at examples of every single one of these guys. I am not leaving anything else out. I'm not leaving anything out. This is the most free value ever given away for free, ever. Moving on. So first, I've got to show you guys the DIC email. Let's check it out. So this subject line says, why celebrating wins in your biz is killing your success? So here goes. So you just caught a big break in your coaching business, hit a career milestone, or accomplished a goal. Before you go out and celebrate the big win, I have some advice for you. Don't. That's right. Don't celebrate that win. And I know that might sound harsh, but here's why I'm saying this. Most trainers never see six figures a month or build that hands-off fitness empire that generates income while they sleep. And it's because every time they hit a milestone or accomplished some goal, they celebrate. They derail their momentum. You ever see a rocket ship launch into outer space? They've got these massive boosters that generate a ton of thrust that pushes the rocket upward. And only once the rocket ship reaches orbit do the boosters release and fall back to Earth. Why is that? Because the amount of effort it takes to gain momentum is a hundred times more than it takes to maintain it. So when you're reaching, so when you're out celebrating in a big win, you're like a rocket ship that launches but stops right before hitting orbit. So you're constantly having to restart your engines to get back up to speed again. And that's a terrible place to be because your competitors are blasting past you, running laps in orbit. While you're out here burning the midnight oil just to get out there, see, business is more than tactics and strategy. If you want to win big, you have to understand these needle movers on a deeper level, which is something I help online trainers do all the time in my personal one-to-one coaching program. We get into tactical stuff, but I also teach you the critical business skills that you need to win at every level. The mindset skills, how to outwork, out strategize, and out-compete your competition. The competition is fierce out here, so if you're not on the cutting edge, you're gonna get left behind. If you feel like you're not where you want to be and you're tired of seeing others pass you up, book a call with me and I'll give you the necessary tools you need to dominate your space as an online coach. So I have some notes here on some certain parts. So why celebrating in your biz is killing your success? So this is kind of a long subject line. The reason why we like to stick to at least or to at most 40 characters in our subject line is because whenever you get an email on your phone or on Gmail, it basically abbreviates it and you don't get to see the whole email if you make it too long. So 40 characters or less is a good rule of thumb. And the disrupt is basically why celebrating your wins in your biz is killing your success. This is going to be disrupting because it goes against common knowledge. It goes against what most people would think. And then basically he just says, I have some advice for you, which is the what's in it for me. We're gonna be speaking more about what's in it for me after, but if you ever see WIIFM, that means what's in it for me. Basically meaning that you have to tell the reader what they're gonna get in advance when they read this email. What am I gonna receive, right? Here he just kind of says I have some advice for you. Also, this is not a perfect email, but like I'm trying to show you guys, all of these emails, like I said, are already $200 and $300 emails. But we can make them even better and eventually get paid even more. Because the more money they make, man, of course it's gonna be the more money you make. This is why most business owners, bro, I've seen email copywriters literally go for 7k a month, 8k a month, 9k a month, mostly because they're just working off commission. Because they're making $90,000, $100,000 a month with just the emails. Anyways, before you go out and start making a big win, I have some advice for you. Don't. That's kind of the disruptor there. And then, I mean, there's some parts where you could have cut this out. I mean, with the emails, you want to be very, very, very concise, right? With every single word. We're gonna talk about that a little bit later afterwards. Generates income while they sleep. Justifications, right. So when you use this analogy, have you ever seen a rocket ship launch into outer space? What is he doing here? So there's a huge thing with emails that you have to make sure that you recognize. When giving advice, or giving value, or telling people what to do, it's not as important to give them advice as it is to tell them why the advice is right, right? So if I get out here and say, you shouldn't celebrate your wins. It will make you lazy. Then you're gonna be like, okay, whatever. You might not even believe me because I just sound like some dude who's out here preaching, right? I said, I actually explained it to you step by step. Well, look, take a rocket ship, for example. And then I tie it to an analogy, tied to something you already know. Now, I'm giving you external reasons as to why you should believe what I'm saying, rather than just being like, well, trust me, bro. Or just like, I'm just gonna tell you this and preach it to you and not give any justification, right? So adding an actual justification and a reason as to why your tips are actually helpful is going to make people really believe in what you're saying and not just depend on being like, yeah, trust me, this is really, really what you should do, right? Because nobody likes when somebody just comes up to them and starts telling them what to do. So you wanna give them a reason as to why your way is the best way. And here, he gives the rocket ship analogy. And basically, it just comes down to this. The amount of effort it takes to gain momentum is 100 times more than it takes to maintain it, just like a rocket ship. And now, you got people going, oh, yeah, you know, that's really true. I never thought about it that way. And they're gaining value because you're giving them that light bulb moment in their head. So when you're celebrating a big win, blah, blah, blah, blah. Also, when he goes down here, he says, in my personal one-on-one coaching program, I wouldn't do that. It's a little bit salesy, right? Even that is a little bit salesy. He's talking about my one-on-one coaching program. Don't really need to go into that, right? What you could do instead is just say like, hey, I made this free video, and in the free video, it sells the program, or something like that. But as you can see, email is not exactly perfect. I mean, if I came in this dude's business, I could probably make him quite a bit more money. Book a call with me, and I'll give you the necessary tools you need to dominate your space as an online coach, boom. So here we have the double CTA, and that's kind of just how he goes, how he does it. Interesting. Next up, we have PAS, which of course is Problem, Agitate, and Solution. Now, this one's interesting. Let's check it out. So, the subject line. The subject line is, big hustle, little growth? Try this. Have you been consuming a lot of business content, but your business is not growing that much? It happens all the time. Whether it's from your favorite YouTuber, or buying programs to grow your business, there is no shortage of advice when it comes to growing your business. You hear it all the time. Promote on TikTok, hire influencers, run discount promotions, go all in on ads, avoid ads, AI will leave us without a job, and on and on. So what does it mean, Tyson? Are they all wrong? Are they all scammers? Are they all parroting out whatever they hear online? Not necessarily. Chances are there is some good advice floating around, sometimes for free. See, getting access to the information is not a problem anymore. You would think getting the right information is the key to growth. It's not. After working with thousands of business owners, do you know what the absolute number one difference is between successful ones and the ones who fail? Execution. No amount of business advice in the world can beat good execution. Even somewhat crappy advice can be turned around with fast, good execution. Can you actually block out a couple of days and define and implement what will move the growth needle in the next 12 months? What about your team? Can they execute? That's the key, if you ask me. Grow smart, Dan Lok. If you don't know who Dan Lok is, he's huge. Huge eight, nine-figure entrepreneur. And even his email copywriting, there's some parts that's not perfect. One part that I caught is that whether you're a favorite YouTuber, buying programs to grow your business, there's no shortage of advice when it comes to growing your business. I mean, he used grow your business twice in one sentence, which makes it sound repetitive and redundant. So I would use some sort of synonym here just to make it sound better. But yeah, even this dude's emails ain't perfect, as you can see. P.S., if you need a little extra help executing well and fast, we have our smart challenge happening soon. If you need to grow now, if you were invited to come and implement it with me, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and there's the CTA. Grow your business in the next 12 months. So, and then there's the CTA. So this email, right, basically it gives value, and then it gives like a by-the-way type of CTA, right? So it sells very, very nonchalantly, right? It's really not salesy. It kind of just leaves the link right there at the bottom, being like, yo, by the way, if you wanna grow your business in the next 12 months, go here, click this link, join us, right? So this is another email. So P.A.S., let's go over the actual structure. First of all, problem. Starts with a problem. Big hustle, little growth? Try this, right? That's the problem. And then here's the agitate. You hear it all the time. Promote on TikTok, blah, blah, blah. So he basically, with the agitate, you want to either extrapolate what's gonna happen long-term. So you've been struggling growing your business. In five years, your business is gonna be the exact same or it's gonna be basically even smaller than it is now and you're gonna be sitting there wondering where the last five years went and you're gonna feel like, I don't know, you wasted a whole bunch of time and you're basically way worse off. That's what you'd feel like. Or you can kind of tell them how it shows up in their life, right, and he's doing the latter. So a big rule in copywriting that you probably will hear, if you stick with copywriting, you'll hear it all the time, is that if you're able to describe someone's problem better than they can, they will naturally trust you when looking for the solution, right? So if you really, really relate to them really well, then they're gonna be like, okay, this person really understands my problem. They're basically inside my head. They're entering the conversation in my head. So they must know the solution. So you're gonna be the trusted expert. So when they tell you to click on a link, what are you gonna do? You're gonna click on that link. And then, oh yeah, over here when he says, after working with thousands of business owners, that's kind of his justification, right? That's his reasoning as to why he's saying this, right? Remember in the last one I told you, you gotta have a reason for your advice? This is kind of his. This is what I've seen over coaching thousands of business owners. And then next up, here's kind of like his lesson, his learning lesson, his value. And then boom, CT at the bottom, very, very soft sell. And that was PAS, my friends. And next up, of course, we have HSO, which is hook, then story, then offer. And this one's a little bit more difficult to pull off, but it is also highly, highly effective. So the subject line is the events that humbled me. Tyson, I thought I was killing it. At the time I had three profitable businesses and 300 units of real estate. I thought I had it made. I was wrong. When the 2008 economic crisis happened, I got hammered. My business got slaughtered. My real estate plummeted in value. Even the bank started calling my loans. Not because I had ever missed a payment. It was because they were the ones in financial trouble. It was a hellish and stressful time, and it took months of hard knocks learning. But I came out of it smarter, richer, and better prepared to survive and thrive. Today, I have multiple highly profitable businesses. My real estate empire is over 4 billion in size. So what did I do differently? A lot. For starters, I didn't shrink my goals. I didn't start playing defense. The other things I did were mostly strategic. I learned how to make my business unbreakable so they could survive any outside forces. And once I did, it no longer mattered what the economy, the competition, or even the environment did. My businesses continued to build, scale, and run like clockwork. Look, I've spent over 40 years developing the plans that have helped me create multiple, highly successful businesses. I've refined and distilled what I've learned down into five actionable frameworks. I use these frameworks to build and scale every business I've created. They work for any type of business. Up until now, I've never shared them with anyone else publicly. But that's about to change. Starting tomorrow, I'll be sharing my proven frameworks for the first time ever. It happens during the Unbreakable Challenge. This is a online five-day event that's happening from January 24th to 28th. And I'd love for you to be there. Here's the link to register. Remember, it's 100% free to attend. Building your business is hard, but you don't have to come up with a plan on your own. You can use my proven frameworks instead. I'm willing to share it with you for free during the Unbreakable Challenge. Make a commitment to yourself now. Make a real plan to learn my proven frameworks so that you can put them into action in your own business. It all begins when you grab your seat at the Unbreakable Challenge. 10X every day, Grant Cardone. P.S., have you claimed your free, whatever, other CTAs. So let's go through and discuss it. So the hook, of course, was the event that humbled me. Now, if you don't know Grant Cardone, he's one of the biggest online entrepreneur business guys that there is. So the event that humbled me, people would be like, oh, wow, an event that humbled Grant Cardone? Also, he's like a very, I don't know, a very outgoing figure. He's very confident. So the event that humbled him will also hook you in because of that. I thought I was killing it. I was wrong. So he was kind of like the hook in the email. Usually, when you go over to the story base, most stories start with time and place. They don't have to. It's not a 100% ironclad rule, but they usually start with time and place. For example, it was 2008. That's the time. The place slash setting, economic crisis happened. So obviously, he's somewhere in the US or something like that. I got hammered. And then over here, he tells what happened. So when you're telling a story, this is super, super important. You all have to understand this. When you are telling a story, the last thing that you wanna do is just retell it. The last thing you wanna do is just talk about it like it was a series of events. This happened, then this happened, and then this happened. What we wanna do is relive the story. Tell me exactly what happened. Describe what happened. And of course, describe how it made you feel. So as we can see here, it was a hellish and stressful time. Why? Because as real estate plummeted in value, every bank was calling my loans, not because I ever missed a payment, but because they were the ones in financial trouble. This line, for example, it doesn't outright say it, but this would feel very unfair. Your loans are all messed up. Everything's down in value, not because of any of your mistake, just because of the economic climate that's happening right now. And it was a hellish and stressful time. Took months of hard knocks, but I came out of it right. And then usually with a story, there's some sort of learning lesson. And the learning lesson is down here. I learned to make my business unbreakable because I changed a lot of things. So that's the lesson for the reader. Next up, and once I did, environment I did, blah, blah, blah, I became unbreakable. And then of course, we transition over to the CTA, where he talks about the unbreakable challenge. I show you how to do all this in the unbreakable challenge. It's a transition, and then boom, it's 100% free to attend. Now again, what is this? This is the top of a funnel. Like I said, these emails aren't selling, but they're making money. You go to here, you register for the free event, and then it says, hey, do you wanna join the VIP? The VIP is an extra 40 bucks or an extra 100 bucks or whatever. And you get to have a backstage pass or this or that or the other thing. That's how this email makes so much money. Man, this email, I can't even calculate how much money this email probably made for Grant Cardone. Grant Cardone is huge, okay, absolutely huge. This easily made tens of thousands of dollars, easily, no doubt. And that, of course, was Hook's story offer. And there's one more that we must go into, which is listicle, listicle, okay. So this is from James Wedmore, also edited and approved by yours truly, Tyson4D. How I went from $200 clients to $100,000 clients is the subject line. Ahem. Hey, Tyson, don't laugh, but yes, I charged my very first coaching client just 200 bucks, not per session, for the entire package. My latest client paid me 100,000, but more on that in a second. You see, back in 2009, someone reached out and asked for coaching. I created this amazing package with a two-hour in-person session, a 90-day plan, and a few follow-up calls. All for $200. Want to know the funniest part? In the end, she asked for her money back. See, at the time, I was still in my stubborn pride state, so I hadn't yet invested in my own coaching. And I didn't have any real experience in the entire coaching process. So when I asked this client why she would like a refund, her response was, I love the plan and the content you gave me, but I didn't implement any of it. Oh, well, I've come a long way since then, and my latest coaching client paid me $100,000 to work one-on-one with me. Yes, $100,000. So what has changed that has allowed me to go from charging $200 a client to $100,000 a client and still get the yes? Three things. Now, this is where the listicle part comes in. One, practice. The more I coach, teach, and help, the more effective of a coach I have become. This means that the more you do it, the more your skills and value to others will increase. This also means life experience. I have more life experience today than I did back then. Two is different clients. Price determines the client. Certain people pay more. for better things. It's just the way it is. That's why people will pay $15,000 for a first class ticket or $600 for a t-shirt. Certain prospects are simply looking for that premium product, and if you don't have a premium price, they actually start to question the product. 3. Different Problems Today I solve very different problems for my clients, and solving bigger problems inherently means more value for your client. Do you think that my $100,000 client is coming to me for an Instagram real content or how to restructure their business to take it to $10,000,000? See the difference? Now here's why I share all of this. I couldn't get to $100,000 clients, 15k VIP days, or 35k masterminds if I didn't start with a $200 start at $200 if I hadn't started, period. And most struggling entrepreneurs are trying to get it all manicured and perfect before they ever start. That's impossible. Action creates clarity, experience causes growth, and consistency breeds momentum. So in short, it doesn't matter where you start. All that matters is that you do. And the most courageous act is to defy the little voice in your head that says you still shouldn't start just yet, that you aren't quite ready, or that the time just isn't right. Well, you already have listened to that voice. Isn't it time you listened to another? The one that can only really hear when the fear isn't on the loudspeaker. This is where I can help. Until Thursday, you can get my complete Get Coaching Clients Fast process for just $97 today, 6 installments of $97, plus a bonus live masterclass with me to show you how to find, attract, and close high-quality coaching clients. Click here to learn more on how to get started. On this CTA, I have to tell you, a lot of the times when it comes to rules and this and that, it's kind of like chess. In chess, you have certain rules that you go by. For example, knights near the rim are grim. You don't want to put your knights near the rim because that limits the amount of space that they have. But sometimes, it's the best move. But most of the times, it's not. That's why the rule is there. And this is the same example. This guy, James Westmore, as you can see, he even said it in the email, he usually works with dudes who are trying to take their company to $10 million. So $97 is basically the same as free in this context. So context matters, audience matters, all that stuff matters. That's why in this context, it's not a big deal that he's like, $97 today. It's actually 6 installments of $97, so it's $600 and he's just mentioning it like it ain't really nothing. Because to these people, it's not really a big deal. So the email in and of itself. So as you can see, we almost kind of have two emails here, right? So here is basically like the hook and story, right? So like I said, the hook is he went from charging $200,000 to $100,000, that's the hook. And then like I said before, a story usually starts with time and place. Back in 2009, the place was, well, somebody reached out asking for coaching. Boom, that's the start of the story. And then the learning lessons, but the learning lessons here is the value. The learning lessons is what's listicle. The listicle aspect or element can really be added to any of those past three email structures that we looked at, right? So listicle is really nice because it gives value and it lets people skim, right? So most of the time people want to skim through emails. So if someone looks at practice and they get the gist that just like around here, they'll go to the next one. Different clients, okay, read a little bit, they get the gist. Different problems, okay, they read a little bit, get the gist. And then they'll just like stop somewhere else down here, right? Because most people are going to skim. That's just the matter of things. But what you want to do in an email is when you add things like this, the listicle part, it gets people to stop skimming and start reading for a minute, right? So if people skim through the story, they're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, not that interested. They'll stop right here to look at the points, okay? Point number one, point number two, point number three. And then they'll look at the CTA, okay, kind of like that. And that, my friends, is the listicle structure. But we ain't done yet, okay? Because those are emails, but what about email sequences, okay? Well, we already touched on this, but here's kind of like more of a deeper understanding. So what is an email sequence? An email sequence is a series of emails that are sent automatically to prospects when they trigger a certain action, also known as autoresponders. Have you ever hear autoresponders? That's what they're referring to. Why are they so effective? Because they are highly scalable, they're automated, and they are personalized. Guys, when you have like 100 people come into your email list, and let's say you convert one of them at $100, 100 people basically means $100. So that means when you have 1,000 people come in, you have $1,000. And you don't have to do any more work. That means it's scalable, right? So with 10 million people come in, you still don't do anything. It's still $10 million. Then the question just becomes, okay, well, how do we get more people into this email? Send them these email sequences, and that's how it happens. What's the difference between email sequence and automation? This one is key. This one is one I didn't understand for a very long time. An email automation can lead the prospect down a different, more personalized path based on the individual actions, whereas an email sequence doesn't. So an email sequence is just, they get email one, email two, email three, that's it. Email automation is they get email one, email two, and then depending on what they do with email two, they get email three A or email three B. Slight difference. Don't let that go over your head. And moving on. So what does an email, what does a sequence actually look like? What are some effective email sequences? They're not just email, email, email, but they can actually work together to complete a task. And I'll show you exactly how to do that. It's quite neat. So here's the three email welcome sequence. So this is what's sent to people when, let's say they download a free resource, right? You exchange your email address for a free resource. And then this is the type of email sequence that you'll probably get. So they'll send you the free resource in your email. So here's your gift. And also here's what to expect. You're going to be getting daily emails, daily emails from me, weekly emails from me or whatever about X, Y, Z, what to expect. Next will be easy to consume value. This might be a listicle email or something of that nature. Easy to consume value. Here's some advice on what you're doing, right? And then next will be even more value, but we'll have a free link or something in the CTA to again, train the reader to click, right? Because it's more important that they know that they can click on the emails without anything spooky happening, basically. Next type of email sequence that we're going over is the three email deadline sequence. So first of all, this is kind of like some of the emails that we went over, right? You send them value in the email, but then you send them a CTA to a product with a deadline. So you see them all the time, right? Oh, this product is going to go away after one week or it's going to go away, blah, blah, blah, right? And we can use this to make a lot of sales. Next might be a promo email about the product that we didn't necessarily go over any promo emails that are just specifically talking about the product, but there's lots of them out there. I'm sure if you open up your email inbox, you can find some, right? So, and then we send like, like I said, the promo email, and then we could hit them with the last chance email. And this email is going to make bank, right? Because people, when people want something or want to buy something, you've probably done this before, but you kind of leave it. You kind of say to yourself, okay, I want this. I want to buy it. I'm going to buy it one day, but you won't actually hit the buy button unless there's a reason as to why you need to buy it right this second. And that's what this gives. There's a whole bunch of people who read these first two emails and like, I do want that product, but they won't buy until they get the third email. So writing your first email, like I said, I'm going to speak to you as if you are a beginner. Some people who are watching this are not beginners, but let's say you are a beginner. What does it look like to write your first email? What do we want to do? Well, first of all, you got to understand that copy isn't written, right? These emails that I'm showing you, they're not written. It's assembled and synthesized. What the hell does that mean, Tyson? Well, like I said, you're not going to be sitting there looking at a blank page, trying to come up with an email or what to write about. You're going to basically research and look at a whole bunch of other emails and you're going to create a course called a swipe file. A swipe file is basically just a place where you store a whole bunch of copy that you like or you think is effective. And then when it comes time to write a piece of copy, you go through, you look through some for inspiration, and you can also just take certain parts of that one bit of copy and put it into something else. You're basically Frankensteining it. Obviously you're not copying, pasting, and ripping off the whole email, but you're taking little parts of each email and you're assembling them. This is called synthesizing. We're taking it all, we're putting it all into one, and we're transforming it. Consume a lot of emails before you start writing, and like I said, start creating your swipe file. And then we have to talk about flow. Flow is how your email reads. If it's choppy or it's hard to understand, conciseness and consumability and clarity are all way, way, way, way, way more important than being clever. You don't have to be clever or creative or come up with some crazy whatever this or that marketing psychology, nothing. It really just comes down to is your email clear? Is it concise? Why do people care? Do people feel compelled to read it and compelled to take action? That's really all it is. What is flow? Flow is what determines if your email is coherent, easy to read, and simple to understand. What's the difference between good and bad flow? Good flow makes the copy clear and allows the reader to follow along with each sentence, whereas bad flow ruins the clarity of your email and makes it hard to read. How do we utilize the one-sentence paragraph? If you guys didn't notice, a lot of the paragraphs that we wrote or that we read are not these big, chunky, blocky blocks of text. They're small, one-sentence paragraphs, which makes it very, very easy. It's almost like you're reading a TikTok, very, very easy to consume. They give the copy a faster pace when reading it and allow you to highlight the crucial points easily. This is why. Now we have to talk about conciseness. When you're not being concise or when you add something in an email that's not needed, it's called fluff. Here's how to know what's fluff and what's needed. We want to be as concise as possible. We want to say the most amount, transfer the most amount of knowledge in the smallest amount of words. That is one of the biggest goals of a copywriter. Ask yourself these two questions. If I took this part out, would it still mean the same thing? Does this email absolutely need that part? Next up, am I trying to sound smart by using big words or by putting this in? We want our copy to be easily understandable by everyone. You don't want to add in big words or whatever to sound smart. You really just want them to be easy and understandable. Rule of thumb is you want it to be easily understood by a fourth grader, a nine-year-old. Short emails versus long emails. What's the ideal length of an email? It depends. Emails can be long as long as they're concise and valuable. If you write a big email, that's okay as long as the information in there is valuable and concise. Some emails, you may want to stick to being short and punchy. A general rule of thumb is to try to stick to around 300 words, give or take a couple hundred. That's basically it. Creating your subject line. Your subject line is one of the most important parts of your copy because if your subject line is not good, what does the rest of it even matter? People's not going to open it. You got to make sure that your subject line is good. What makes a subject line bad? If it's too long because then it'll be cut off or it's just not easy to read. Too boring or generic. Here's how to lose weight. Boring, generic, there's no creativity, it's just boring, it's a terrible subject line. Too intriguing slash mysterious. If it's just really random or has nothing to do with what the actual email is about, it basically is akin to clickbait on YouTube. People don't like clickbait. Why? Because they'll click on the video but they're not actually going to watch it. Here are some examples of some bad subject lines. How to make money online and get rich quick. Obviously that's salesy and also very generic. An example of something that's too clickbaity is knock, knock Elon Musk. What does that even mean? What is the email going to be about? It's not really that intriguing. It's kind of clickbaity. And then one that's just too generic and boring again is just get jacked now. Get jacked now. Also, this one's too long. What makes a subject line good? Well, it's concise. Under 40 characters like we discussed. Curiously familiar. You want to add a little bit of curiosity but not too much that it's clickbait. You want it to be familiar but not too boring. Also challenging. Take something that your reader probably believes and flip it on its head and tell them that it's actually wrong. That kind of sets the tone for your email. That's why people will open it. For example, less pushups equals a stronger chest. You might read this and go like, well, what does that even mean? I thought if you want a strong chest, you've got to do more pushups. But the subject matter inside of the email could be something like you're doing pushups, but really if you want to reach hypertrophy and build a bigger chest, you've got to do bench press or dumbbell press or this or that or whatever. Basically saying that you need more weights than just doing pushups. This is, like I said, it's challenging belief. Next up, how close to 3K deal in seven minutes. Sounds so crazy. But you know you kind of want to know exactly how, what are they claiming? Are they claiming that they literally just whatever, got rich quick whatever or is there actually some truth behind this? What does he mean? And next is Netflix keeps you poor, here's why. That's kind of like a value-driven one, right? It tells you something and it's also kind of challenging, right? Most people have Netflix. By saying this, you're like you know, here's the real reason. Next up, of course we have to explain what's in it for me, right? So we kind of touched on it a little bit but here's the real definition. The what's in it for me section lets the reader know what benefit he will get from continuing to read the email. Why we use what's in for me? Well because it grabs people's attention while also ensuring that will keep the reader until the end. Have you ever seen a youtuber be like, oh well make sure you stay to the end because I'm gonna give you XYZ blah blah blah blah blah blah. That's basically what you're doing in the email. You're basically telling them, you know, here are the three things that helped me do XYZ or here's what's gonna help you blah blah blah. Actually we have some examples right here. Here are the three most effective strategies I used to melt away fat without doing any cardio. I'm gonna show you the true key to closing clients in this email or when you find out my NT mindset framework, doing the hard work will be so much easier. What's in it for me? Now of course the CTA, which stands for call to action. Maybe I should have said that a little bit earlier for you guys who are brand new, but it stands for call to action. So you want to make it smooth instead of disjointed. Notice how the ones that we just read transitioned to the CTA instead of just plopping it in there. Next we want to make it benefit based. A lot of them said if you want to XYZ then click here to download ABC whatever. And next up be clear on what the reader should do next. So a lot of the times people are like make sure you sign up for my whatever, but they're like well how do I sign up? It's like say no click here to sign up for my three-day challenge or what have you. And next up is a copywriting tip that you must know which is features versus benefits. Features versus benefits. So we have some features here. A feature might be a training program, a coaching call, or an ebook. But the benefits over here. A training program so that you can have guidance every step of the way. A coaching call so that you can have a plan that's tailored to you. Or an ebook so that you can learn to close clients. So features or basically what it is benefits or how it helps you. So what's the difference like it says right here. The feature tells you what you get whereas the benefit tells you how what you will get will help you. So how do you fix it? If you have features or whatever in your copy you basically just add so you can or a variation of this and you'll follow with a proper benefit every single time. So a training program so that you can have guidance every step of the way. A coaching call so that you can have a plan tailored to you. Understand? Kind of kind of make sense now? So guys that basically leaves you with the copywriting side of things. But and of course this video isn't done we still got quite a bit to cover. But I have if you want to learn more about copywriting I have three more free courses on copywriting that will show you how to build your skill at this. Also I have the free AI copywriting course. So if English isn't your first language or if you're just a complete beginner I show you how to level up your copy with just using AI. Just using ChatGBT of course. ChatGBT is free. The video is free and you can get a long way and start making money with this easily just by watching these a couple of videos as well as this one. Okay so more about email sequence. So now I'm gonna get you guys to actually learn how to create your very first email sequence. Because like I said there's gonna be action steps in here. It's not just me showing you're teaching you. So here's what your three email sequence might look like. Welcome and what to expect. Right? So pick a product or a sales page or anything that you find. A good way that I like to do this when I was first practicing email copywriting. People always ask me how do I find copy? How do I find it? How do I find it? Go to a sales page. Right? So what I do and a good way to do this this is this is genius I'm not gonna lie. You want to start out writing copy about things that you like or understand because it will make it less complicated for you. If you're trying to write copy about something you don't understand it's just gonna be you're just gonna get to a roadblock. You're gonna be like I don't understand how to write copy and I don't understand this thing and I'm trying to sell them the copy. So you what you want to do is go on Instagram and click on the ads. Right? Click on the ads on Instagram. The ads on Instagram are also tailored to you. They're tailored they're based on the things that you already watch and click on so you're all gonna already gonna have an understanding somewhat of what it is. Okay? So if you're looking for things to write about that is probably the best way to do it. So first of all welcome and what to expect. Basically welcome them to the email list and tell them what to expect. This was kind of just a utility email. You don't have to get too creative with it just tell them what they're gonna get. Next up is a listicle value email. Right? This is to add value. So give them some advice or give them some tips one two three just like that. Kind of like we already saw. Okay? Next up is a train to click email. This is where you give them value and then you give them a CTA and add a link at the bottom and you tell them this is a free such-and-such click below if you want to get access. And that is what your first three email sequence is going to look like. And next is a three email promo sequence. The deadline one just like we kind of spoke about earlier. So this is the value email with a promo to the CTA. So a promotion with a link to the product. Then we have a straight promo email. This is basically you giving them short description of what the product is how it's going to help them and remember here that you want to add their features and turn them into benefits. And then next up of course is the last last chance email. This email super super simple. You can really just put this is your last chance to buy such-and-such. Here's what's inside and then you give a really short bullet list of what's inside and then you add a call to action link at the bottom. Boom boom done. So part eight. Here's the start strategy. Okay so here's how to actually go about writing the emails getting better. So start. S-T-A-R-T is an acronym. So start starts with synthesize and swipe. So Frankenstein is Frankenstein the best parts of copy. Okay you're gonna pick your product. Okay I want to write about this. Then you're gonna look at the sales page of the product. You're gonna look at sales page of similar products. You're gonna pick out parts of the copy or parts of the writing that you like and then you're gonna start putting it into your own words. Then you're gonna target. You're gonna think about who is your target audience. It is gonna work for old people, for men, for women, right? You want to keep that in mind. Remember the old remember the last email that we looked at where he was talking about you know it's only $97. You're not selling to people who are broke who are looking to make money online for the first time. You're selling to people who want to grow their business from 1 million to 10 million, right? Next is to actualize. One of the best ways to improve your flow or improve how your email reads is to read it out loud and read it out loud after 24 hours. When you come back to your email after 24 hours you're gonna be like damn what was I thinking? Because when you're writing the email you're like oh yeah this makes sense because you know what you're trying to say but when you leave it and come back now you don't know what you're trying to say and you're gonna read it more like you know the actual subscriber who's reading the email. Next up is to review. Share your copy with others and review their copy. We could do this in the free discord that I've linked down below this video. I'm gonna talk about that a little bit more later. And next is treat, right? The last step is to treat. Use your feedback to improve and then also you can go back and resubmit your copy later once you've improved it. So here's exactly what to do next, okay? Here are the important action steps to do next. First of all join the free discord copywriting community to get your emails reviewed. Just go down there in the free discord you join you go to the copy submissions tab and you can go there and submit your copy and you can also look at everybody else's copy. People are uploading copy they're like every five minutes so you can go there look more about what this what these types of emails look like understand them more and conceptualize it and then you can start writing your emails you can review other people's emails such on and so forth. And then next go ahead make sure that you share this video with your other fellow copywriters, okay?
