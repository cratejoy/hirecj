What's up, Copy Squad? It's your boy, Kyle Milligan, coming to you live from Baltimore, Maryland. And today, I want to talk about copywriting for hypnotists. Essentially, I want to go over some unique mechanism stuff. I'm going to show you a question that I just had. So here's the question. Basically, Cecilia asked me to ask you something. What would be a unique mechanism about a hypnosis course to sell to elite athletes during or after sport life? Okay. So what she's looking for is a unique mechanism. She asked this question on my unique mechanism video, three ways to come up with your unique mechanism because it does all the work. So she said, okay, what would be a unique mechanism for hypnosis course? All right. So my response is, I can help. Yeah, sure. Can you give me more details about the product itself and why they need that course? How will it benefit them as athletes specifically? Unfortunately, I didn't get a lot of elaborate feedback, but I think this is important to address because I want to start here. I think this answer kind of shows me one of the kind of issues that's occurring with where she's stuck. She said, thank you so much. I'm attending a copywriting course and we have to write a sales page, focus on elite athletes, so that's your market, to deal with their sport and their daily lives. So hypnosis, she thought, hypnosis is a great help to allow them to go on with their lives. I don't know how to get the unique mechanism. I need ideas. I don't want to use you for free, but I'm stuck. Okay. So why are you stuck? Let's talk about that. So I said, yeah, can you give me details about the product itself and why they need that course? How will it benefit them as athletes specifically? And this is why you're stuck. Because as soon as I asked that question, I did not get an answer to what are the details of the course? What are you offering? So I said, Hey, well, what are the details about the course? Like what makes this thing beneficial for athletes in particular? So instead of saying, here's the course, here's why athletes need it, or here's why it's helpful. She said, I will have to come up with a unique mechanism. And I think the problem with this is she's trying to come up with something. So I think I, I harp this all the time. I say that, you know, as copywriters, we are not, I don't personally believe that I'm creative. I think I do research. I think the research gives me everything I need to write the sales letter. I think the research is, uh, it does the work for you. Right? So the reason I say that, and this is kind of one of those things being, it's being shown to us firsthand. So when, instead of being able to tell me exactly what was in the course, and then me finding a unique mechanism inside that course and the details, she said, I'm having trouble coming up with it. Do you see already the foundational problem? It starts with the product itself. Now I want to give you a couple of quick tips. So I got this from nobody wants to read your S word by Steven Pressfield. Steven Pressfield, before he was a novelist, before he was a screenwriter for movies was a copywriter. And he says that when you're writing a movie, you should start at the climax, started the climate, started the big finish, and then work your way back. When I'm thinking about that for a copywriting assignment, like sales letter, the climax for us is when we put everything together, all the hype at the beginning, how this is all possible and how it works. Then I pull the curtain back and show you the product in action, right? Then I show you exactly the technical explanation of the product. And from there, that's where you develop your unique mechanism. So that's the, that's the climax. It's what you're building the whole sales letter up to why you must absolutely, certainly need this thing. Okay. So what you do is you first do the research. Okay. So to find your unique mechanism. So there was three types of unique mechanisms I listed on that video. It was the existing mechanism, the unspoken mechanism, and the transubstantiated mechanism. So to, in order to get that answer, you first need to completely and fully understand what it is that you are selling. So when I asked, I said, okay, well give me some details about what you're selling because I can't help you come up with a unique mechanism. I need to know what it is you're selling. Then I can show you basically you, you take those things, right? So if it's a stock picking service, it could be something like, like look at the V3 trader. Well in copy squad inner circle, which is another banner I can put up and the copy squad inner circle, we went over this promo called the V3 trader by money map. And whenever you look at how the V3 trader functions for about 50 pages, we're reading about all these examples and hype and how this is possible. And then he finally pulls the curtain back, you know, 70% of the way through and he shows you, look, when this happens, that happens and that happens, a stock explodes and we call it the V3 protocol or something like that. So everything that led up to that moment, all was hinging on the fact that it came down to this V3 thing, how it works. So how do you come up with the unique mechanism? The first thing is you need to understand your product inside and out. If it's a hypnotism product is what she said to be great for athletes, right? So if it's a hypnotism product and you need a unique mechanism, how are you hypnotizing them? It's the only way, it's the only thing in the world that's only five minute training in the world, right? So that's the only thing that makes it unique, right? The word only needs to be in your, in your unique selling thing. So how are you hypnotizing them? What are you saying to them when they're hypnotized? What sort of exercises are they going through under when they're under the hypnosis spell? All right. Once I know all the details, I say, well, we're the only one that does that. Bam, unique selling proposition, unique mechanism. They're all built inside of completely and fully understanding your products. So let's go back. Let's revisit, bring it all full circle here on that comment itself. So I said, can you give me more details about the product itself? If you can tell me what you're doing to them, I can tell you what a unique mechanism could possibly be. But instead of getting that, what I got back was I was thinking hypnosis is a great help to allow them to go on with their lives. I don't know how to get the unique mechanism. Well, it sounds like when I say, give me product details. And so maybe, maybe Cecilia has all the product details. And this was just like her, her first reactions. I'm not saying she doesn't know what she's selling, but until it starts with the details, you, you parse it out into all the little micro components of it. And then you pick one, you pick one, you say, yeah, hypnosis is great. But the way we do it, the unique mechanism that we have, whether it's existing, whether it's unspoken, whether it's trans substantiated, whatever it may be, it starts at first completely understanding the product and what it is you're offering and the result that you're going to deliver. Once you understand the product, how it works inside and out. So in my mind, when I saw this response, I thought, Oh, she just got to write something for a copywriting training. She's not really got a product in her hands to sell, right? As a copywriter, we sell a product, right? We, you give us a product. Like that's why financial and health niches pay so much money is because finance is always buy low, sell high. That's, that's the finance in a nutshell health. It's consume fewer calories than you burn. That's how you get in shape. Now, how do we spin that every single day into something unique and exciting and, and P90X with muscle confusion and the, you know, the, the South beach diet and the Palm beach diet and Atkins diet and the carnivore diet, the keto diet, how do you take consume fewer calories than you burn and make it new every single day? That's the copywriter's job. But the copywriter first has to understand exactly what it is that they're selling. And then they pick the unique element of that ketosis. Why is meat and leafy greens so good ketosis, right? So then you just make the whole thing hinge on this one unique part of it. Oh yeah. It causes ketosis and then everything else revolves around that idea. But first you have to understand the diet. You have to understand a little bit about like the body and the scientific, like sort of biological things that are happening and then you can kind of sell it. So the answer to the copywriting for hypnotists or hypnosis courses or whatever you're selling like that first, what is the hypnosis course? What are the modules? What are you doing? Break that apart and then choose your one thing that you think has the strongest. When I say strongest, it means most unique and valuable at the same time. It's beneficial. It's super beneficial. You know, no one knows about it. It's, it's, you can say it's uniquely yours and it can be anything about the process. Like get granular step-by-step about what you're doing with your hypnotism course. Right? And that means, okay, you come in, we sit down, you lay down on this couch, you have this special pillow, right? It's our special hypnotism pillow. It's made of special goose feathers from Everest, right? That's a unique thing. I don't know. It could be like, that's what I'm saying. Get granular with it and figure out the weird wonky things. Don't dismiss anything as stupid. Get down granular and what it is that you're actually offering, which you may discover one. Hypnotism might not be the best one for you cause you're not familiar enough to sell it in this copywriting course that you're taking right now. This is directed directly at the person who asked the question. So she says, you know, I'm attending a copywriting course and we have to write a sales page. So if you're not really familiar with hypnotism or hypnotism courses, that might not be a good one. But if you are now, get really, if you are already familiar with that sorts of stuff, then what you want to do is get granular about what it is that you're selling. We don't make stuff up as copywriters. We do research. When we're trying to sell a product, we simply research very deeply into the granular aspects of that product. And then we figure out what we can say is that's weird. That's unique. I've not heard that before. Then you sell that. All right. So yeah, so that's it. No more time for questions. I really do appreciate everyone who watched, appreciate all the feedback, all love. I hope this was very valuable for anyone who needed to hear about unique mechanisms or sell a hypnotism course. Start with the product. We don't make stuff up. We research into what we're selling. All right. And then, and then if you're making up a product to sell at a copywriting course or a copywriting assignment or something like that, you're making it the product to sell. Then the struggle that you're going to have is you don't really have a full grasp on the product or the result that has had already demonstrated how it works because you're kind of making it up. All right. So maybe pick a product that already exists that you can research into. All right. So I haven't talked about the big four emotions in this video. Kylerwriter.com forward slash book is where I talk about big four emotions and how you can sell basically anything. Kylerwriter.com forward slash squad is a group where we talk about this stuff in a closed private group. Feel free to sign up there. All right. Thanks so much for tuning in. Peace out. God bless you.
