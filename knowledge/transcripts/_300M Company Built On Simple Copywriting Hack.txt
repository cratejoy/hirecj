What's going on everyone? I wanted to share the rule of one with you that I learned from Michael Masterson And if you haven't heard of Michael Masterson, he's the the chief growth Strategist at Agora Publishing which to my knowledge is the biggest information seller on the market They do over a billion dollars a year in revenue, and he is the person who created their entire acquisition machine Which is teams and teams of hundreds of copywriters who generate demand through compelling words And I think there's something really magical about that because he not only has been able to do it himself and hit home run after Home run at a for home run offer But he's been able to duplicate it and other people and create and get people who've never sold a thing to writing copy that generates 20 million 40 million 80 million plus just from a single letter or message and In his book great leads the first concept that he introduces is arguably the most important and he calls the rule of one and I've been I It was just so important to me that I wrote it down and I have it right in front of my computer Because it applies to almost everything but especially to communication and sales messages And so whenever he said the common thing that most copywriters do or most business owners who are trying to make an offer To be compelling to a marketplace what they do is they just stack as many different Great things inside as they possibly can and then say well if that one doesn't work one of them will work So I'm just gonna throw them all in and he said that's the recipe for he calls toss salad copy Which is just you just jumble everything together and you hope you know, it's throw everything on the wall Let's see what sticks But the reality is the most compelling messages and he reviewed the top 100 offers of all times since they worked there 91 of them all Centered on a single concept And so if you think about what that means It means that you're looking for the one big idea the one compelling message that has to be easy to understand easy to believe and interesting or unique and so he said those are the three elements of a one big idea and so when you're Thinking about the sales messaging and this has been really just I've been I've been putting this as a forefront of my mind Is that when you're writing copy for a for an advertisement or you're writing copy for a landing page? The sub bullets should only be bullets that reinforce the singular message or the singular argument Right, they should be stories. They should be Arguments, they should be facts that are presented solely to reinforce the singular concept, right? and so if I said, you know, hey, there's six ways six ways to To you know, wake up earlier or something like that Or six morning strategies if each one of them was kind of different that's like it's it's a tossed salad Whereas if I wanted to send it around one big benefit or one core topic now the six topics that I could have underneath of it are gonna still be sub points of the major one rather than You know 15 crazy headline ideas, right? and so for me that has been incredibly powerful and if you look at if If you have advertised before and you look at the best converting advertisements that you've ever had You will probably see that similar trend where the ones that do best are the simplest the most direct and the clearest to understand Now the issue is when you only have to pick one it forces you to be incredibly Tactful on your selection because you're only going to pick one And so I think what that ends up doing is it forces us as marketers to really think is this the is this the best? idea is this the most centralized focused concept that I can point as the tip of my spear of my Communication message, right? And so a lot of these things around like any kind of unique selling proposition That's going to be the rule of one, right? You don't want to have 19 selling propositions. You want to have one core one that everyone can immediately understand is is counterintuitive and Is believable, right? And so when you put all three of those things together, then you have a message That's compelling and people will take one step towards you And so I have now like I said I wrote that at the top of my computer and as I've been writing copy And keeping this atop of mind because I can guarantee you that even since I started doing this just even reading the book I've gotten the the copy that I've been putting out has been so much better and more targeted and crisper because there's one central idea I'm trying to convince the reader or prospect of And then and then the sales message that follows is actually very transparent and simple to write The hard part is figuring out what that one idea is going to be But if you're gonna think about one thing then that would be the one to focus on So anyways, I hope that was value before you I share this stuff as it comes to me In my in my journey of marketing and in sales And so I hope you enjoy this like subscribe all that kind of stuff and I'll see you next video. Bye You
