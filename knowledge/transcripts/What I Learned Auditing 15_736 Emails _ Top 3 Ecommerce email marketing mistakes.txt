My agency and I have audited 15,736 ecommerce emails, and these are the top 3 things that most brands, including some big ones, do wrong. Personalization, content, and calls to action. In this video, I want to show you some concrete examples of those mistakes that cost you thousands of dollars and show you how to fix them. A quick note that this video is sponsored by AdRoll, but more on them in just a little bit. And if you're new here, welcome, my name is Kasey, and I run Luck & Co. Agency. On this channel, I share marketing and retention strategies for ecommerce businesses. Everything that I share comes from experience of running retention marketing for 7- and 8-figure ecommerce brands, so you know that you're getting the real deal. If you don't want to miss anything, make sure that you subscribe to the channel and say hi to me in the comments. Personalization Okay, so huge mistake number one when doing email marketing? Personalization. Or lack thereof, I should say. We found that a staggering 68% of ecommerce emails are not personalized at all. That means no mention of the recipient's first name, no tailored messaging based on their purchase history or behavior, nothing. And that's a huge missed opportunity. And I should say that the second biggest mistake in this category is trying to personalize but failing. The classic example of this is messing up the first name placeholder. The type you see on the screen is the most embarrassing example of this. But writing high space comma is almost just as bad in my book. Here's some easy ways to do personalization right and increase the click rate and conversion rate of your emails. First name and abandoned checkout emails. Start with abandoned checkout emails. This is the part of the customer journey where you have a lot of information about the shopper and where the stakes are pretty high. Your leverage for influencing a purchasing decision here is huge. Address the recipient by first name, but always, always have a default value. What's a default value? If the recipient does not have the first name recorded in their profile, what should show up in its place? The most common option is friend or there so that it reads hi friend or hi there. But if you can make the default value more unique and relevant to your brand, even better. Hey Adventurer for a travel brand or Hey Mama for a maternity brand are all great options. Here's a bonus tip and a more advanced technique. Reach out to your email platform and ask them how to force capitalize the first letter of the name even if the shopper got it wrong in the checkout form. I think you'll agree with me that Hi Casey looks much better than Hi Casey when coming from a brand. Smart product feed. Here's another way to increase sales from your emails by doing personalization right. If you're featuring suggested products in any way in your emails, make it a smart product feed. Reach out to the support of the email platform that you're using and ask them how to make it happen. Any email platform that is focused on e-commerce should have this feature. Here's how Coach does it right. This is the item that I put in my bag and here are more items that they're suggesting to me in their abandoned checkout email. All of them are right on point. Do you know how to set up a smart product feed like that?

I can't even begin to tell you how many emails my team and I open that show the product that the brand is selling, but give no reason for me whatsoever to buy it. The subject line would be something like, you forgot this, and then the email would show me the product that I abandoned and the call to action to shop now. And that's it. I'm sorry, but why should I buy from you in the sea of 10,000 other brands that are trying to sell me their stuff? When you send emails like I'm showing on the screen right now, you're doing the bare bare minimum, reminding a person of the action that they took. Remember that the whole point of sending emails is either to help shoppers overcome objections, or to convince them to buy, or both. And if you're just showing me the product, your convincing game is very, very weak. By the way, this approach goes beyond email. The whole job of marketing in general is to overcome objections and give reasons to buy. You should be doing that on your website, on your social media, and on other marketing channels too. But we're talking about email here, so let's come back to it. Now let's look at this abandoned checkout email. We're showing the product that the person abandoned, but then we tackle the main hesitations that shoppers have, the price. We call it out directly, and then we provide not one, not two, but three arguments for why it's worth it, and then strengthen it with social proof in the form of reviews, and top it all off with a happiness guarantee. And that's how it's done. Calls to action Another key element of email that many brands get wrong is the call to action. In too many emails, CTAs are either too boring, too far down the email, too small on mobile, or non-existent. Remember that the whole point of email is to get the reader to the website, and people need something to click. Even if you're linking the images in your email, you still need a button if you want your click rate to be high. So remember, always have at least one button in your email. Don't put two buttons next to each other. If you can avoid it, two buttons side-by-side will negatively affect your click rate because they create analysis paralysis. Any time that you're asking your reader to make decisions, you're adding friction. Next, try to have your buttons higher up in the email. Not everybody who opens your emails reads everything or scrolls to the button. So the higher up the button is, the more people will see it, and as a result, the more people will click it. Visually, make sure that buttons are easy to click, even on mobile, and even with fat fingers or fingers with long nails. This means that your buttons shouldn't be tiny, they need to stand out visually, and that's why I always advise against ghost buttons or outline-only buttons. And finally, as a more advanced level, try to have fun with your CTAs while keeping them clear. Shop Now or Buy Now are good, but if you can make your CTAs more interesting, you'll see that people will click more. I'm showing a few examples of fun CTAs on the screen right now. Obviously, these would be highly specific to your brand and your audience, but this should give you some inspiration. Remember to stay clear, though. A good rule of thumb is to have at least one straightforward CTA in the email, and then you can have more fun with the rest of them. If you're thinking, well, writing CTAs like that probably requires some stellar copywriting skills, you're right. Go check out my video on how to become a better copywriter with 5 easy techniques. It should be linked on the screen right now. Thank you so much for watching until the end. A special shout out again to AdRoll, and a huge thanks for sponsoring this video.
