Hi everyone. Does it work? All right. Thank you guys so much for coming. I'm so glad to be here. I'm Armin Ibrisagich. I work as a game designer and PR manager at Coffee Stain. I was supposed to tell you guys something before I started. It was turn cell phones on silent and there was one other thing, right? Did I forget something? Evaluation. Yeah. What was that? Yeah. Remember to give evaluations, right? And hopefully remember to give good evaluations. Anyway, I'm here to talk about Goat Simulator. I'm going to talk about basically the marketing lessons that I've learned. It's been a hell of a ride and I'm happy to share them with you guys. So actually I started out as a level design intern initially on Magica. Right after that, I got a job at Coffee Stain Studios. I was doing level design, game design, that kind of stuff. And when my contract was about to expire, they were looking for someone who could do PR. And I pretended that I knew how to do PR. So I got the chance to do that and so I basically learned what I was doing. That's my background. I don't have any actual PR education, but in some ways I think that's actually a good thing. So Coffee Stain in 2013, we're in a really tricky situation. We had just finished Sanctum 2, which was like our biggest IP back then. We had been working on Sanctum for two years I think in total. And then Sanctum 2 for another two years. So we were pretty, we weren't sick of our game, but we felt that we wanted to do something different. So we prepared to start a whole new IP that was going to be like our next big game that we're going to work on, which wasn't Goat Simulator though. It was something totally different. This really big game that we were planning to make. And basically we just had a one month game jam for people that weren't involved in pre-production. So we could basically just play around, do whatever we wanted. I pitched Goat Simulator as an idea and luckily I got some people that started working on it with me. And that's how the game started. During the early days of Goat Simulator, we weren't really planning on making a big game. We mostly focused on playing around, learning new tools. We bought all the 3D assets from the internet, because it's not like we're going to release it anyway. It's just a stupid goat game. And the project was really relaxed. It wasn't that serious. You would basically just go to work, work on whatever you felt like doing, and put it in the game. No one was keeping track of what was in the game. You know how game jams are. So it wasn't really super serious. This was our planning. I know this is in, I'm from Sweden, this is moose talk, but I can translate it to you. Basically it just says, first week a goat, other week a goat that moves, then a goat that moves on a level, then a goat that can do a trick, and so on. That was basically our planning. So it wasn't really, there wasn't really anything that was solid or set in stone. And you knew basically what you should be working on, but it was still really free, and you could do pretty much whatever you wanted. Then one day I put up a really short video of gameplay on YouTube, and just over one night it just exploded. I went to sleep and when I woke up it was all over my Facebook feed. We got, I think it has like 6 million views now or something. It was insane. We were never used to having this much eyes on us and this much attention. So our main thing was that we were, we just felt like, how do we not mess this up? Because obviously there's a lot of people looking at us, we have a lot of cool things that we, a lot of potential customers, and how do we do something, make something good out of this? Because the game was still, it was like three or four weeks into development. It was pretty scary. But later on we felt like, we basically took everyone from our other projects, we're 20 employees at Coffee Stain. We took everyone, put them on Gold Simulator. We kept adding content into the game, but we still figured that we don't want to do any, we don't want to transition into a serious game. We still wanted to keep the playful kind of style. I'm sure we could have, you know, we had a couple million views on our YouTube trailer. We could have gone to a publisher and be like, oh hey, give us this much money, we'll make a AAA goat game for $60. It'll be, you know, GTA with goats. But that wasn't really the spirit of the game, because I think the game went viral because it was so small and so stupid and kind of buggy. So we just wanted to keep going in the same, in the same spirit that the first trailer was. The giraffe thing. So I was doing an interview with a journalist, and they always ask the same questions. They ask me, why do you play a goat? Why don't you play a giraffe or a bear or something? And I was getting pretty tired of the questions, so I was like, well, you know, giraffes are just basically really tall goats, and bears are just really fluffy goats. And as I was going back to my, as I was going back to my desk, I figured, you know, wait a second, maybe there's something here. So I went to our animator, and I asked him, if I would buy a giraffe off of the internet, would you have time to animate it? And since we had no planning, he was like, yeah, sure, I can do it tomorrow. So we did. At the end of the week, we had a playable giraffe, and as soon as you could play the giraffe, we were just like, yes, this is perfect. We've got to do this. And now unlockable goats are like a huge part of the game. If you Google tall goat, there's an actual picture of a giraffe. But we, you know, we decided that there's no freaking out allowed. We've still got to do it in the same way as the game was from the start. We knew that reviewers wouldn't like it. You know how they grade games? They're like, gameplay, 7 out of 10, graphics, 6 out of 10, audio. You know, if you play goat simulator like that, then you don't really get the game. So we just didn't bother. We just didn't get in touch with reviewers. They would ask me for keys, and I just wouldn't even answer them back. We actually tried to calm down the hype, which, you know, people are always like, oh, I know what you're doing. You're doing like reverse psychology. Not at all. We just felt like there were people that we had comments on our YouTube video, and people were like, oh, I can't wait till you guys add animal control in the game, and like helicopters like in GTA. And we don't even have any AI. Like the reason that NPCs just run in a random direction in goat simulator and trip over buckets and everything on the floor is because they have no pathfinding. They just run somewhere, and then they trip over. So there's no chance that we're going to have time to put that in the game anyway. So we felt that, you know, we wanted to calm down people and be like, hey, relax. This is going to be a game that you play for an hour, and you have fun, and that's it. It's not going to be, you know, the next GTA except with goats. And also the bottom line is sometimes like people, when I'm at PAX and stuff like that, people walk up to me and they're like, oh, sell me on goat simulator. And I'm always like, you know, there's no sunshine I can blow up your ass that will make you like the game. If the name goat simulator doesn't excite you, then, you know, there's nothing I can do. And you probably hate having fun. But I feel like it was really, really important that people knew what they got, and they knew what they were buying, and that they didn't, you know, jump into the game and be like, oh, this is just, you just play a goat and do stupid things, because that's the game. Anyway, when we released the game, it sold great. It outsold all our other games in a matter of days, I think. We noticed that we don't actually need journalists to like our game. We got terrible reviews. We got like 1 out of 10. They told us that we were the worst game ever. But we still sold really well. So we figured that we don't need journalists to like our game. We just need them to talk about it. And then you can let players decide whether they like it or not. And the funny thing is that we would get reviews that were like 1 out of 10, this is terrible. And then they'd notice, I'd talk to journalists, and they'd be like, oh, goat simulator reviews, even though they're terrible, they get like three times as many hits as other articles. They get like so many more comments. I suppose because it's a very polarizing game. Either you hate it or you love it. And so we would have journalists that would give us 1 out of 10 and say this sucks, no one should play it. And then they started putting up articles like, you know, this is how you find all the goats in goat simulator. Most fun places to go in goat simulator because they noticed that they were getting hits, right? So that was funny. I would just send them this picture. I don't care. When we released the game, I remember when I wrote the key features for Sanctum 2, and I was so nervous. It was like the first time I was doing it. And I took like weeks. I was writing it. I was like correcting every single word. Nothing can be wrong. You know, exchange this word to this other word because this other word sounds more action related. But for goat simulator, I didn't have time for goat simulator. So I just wrote like, you know, you can be a goat, you do stupid things. And I didn't actually, I was like, okay, this will work for now. And then when the game releases, I'll maybe change it later. And as soon as I updated it on Steam, it got up on the first page of Reddit because people thought that it was so funny that we were actually being honest with, you know, what our game is about. And we weren't, you know, trying to sell people on our game because that's what I tried to do with Sanctum 2. We were like, you know, you have 16 maps and 8 weapons and this many enemies and a high speed action game, shoot things. But with goat simulator, we were just like, you know, it's a dumb game. And if you like dumb stuff, you're going to like it. If not, then no problem at all. Save your money. It's probably better that you save your money anyway. So after this happened, I settled on a kind of a PR policy for the game. I decided that we're going to focus on our community. We're not going to focus on scoring high reviews with the press because they're not going to like it anyway. So, you know, why bother? We're not going to oversell because it's just not consistent with the game. It's not that type of game. Controversial articles are better than good reviews because controversial articles get, if an article makes you angry, then you link it to your friends or you link it in your Skype chat or you talk about it with people on Reddit. And if there's actual discussion to be made, then people can talk in the comments and they engage much more with actual articles. And again, when I wrote the press releases for Sanctum 2, I was trying to make it as shiny and as blingy and cool as possible. But in Goat Simulator, basically the only important thing was to make, you know, short quotes that describe the game and, you know, short feature lists instead of trying to impress people. I don't know if you're aware, we did an MMO expansion. There's some background info for that. We got a lot of requests to add multiplayer to our game, which is impossible because you can't add multiplayer into Goat Simulator. We would have to remake the game from scratch. It would take us two years. And when we would add it, and we would probably have to add it for free, right? And when we would add it, people would just be like, oh, are people still playing this? Is this still relevant? So, you know, we could never do multiplayer. But we could do a fake MMO. So we made a fake MMO with, like, scripted goats that ran around. We had a chat that me and another designer scripted where, you know, fake players would yell at each other. You know, they would sell iron swords for 12 gold and they would call each other nerds and idiots and, you know, don't trust RazorKiller33. He's a scammer. He stole my gold. All that kind of stuff. And we would actually have people who thought it was a real MMO. So obviously it worked. We would have to add it for free, though, because we were scared that we were going to get sued. And the feature list in the MMO was also, like, really stupid. You can play a warrior, rouge, magician, hunter in a microwave. Level cap was... So we released this right when World of Warcraft released their... What was it? Warlords of Draenor. And their level... They increased their level cap from 90 to 100. So we had to make it 101. We had 100, actually. But then, like, I think two or three days before release, they announced their... No, I saw their level cap two or three days before we released. And I went to a programmer and I was like, can you change it to 101? He was like, yeah, no problem. It's like, you know, one minute of work. So we put level cap 101. And that was actually a thing that was quoted a lot. We got featured on Engadget, which have, like, they have, like, 1.5 million... Followers on Twitter or something And you know it came out. I think came out like the same week that World of Warcraft released their expansion and in the press release, I think we wrote something like We're we apologize to the employees Blizzard if they see any Decrease in sales because we released our MMO expansion at the same time as them And that was quoted a lot, too We made a zombie expansion later on And by then I had learned this you know quotable thing So the first thing that we have like the main motto We have we had was that it was the only survival game on Steam that isn't in early access And that it probably isn't true. I'm sure there's tons of games in there that aren't in early access There are survival games, but you know it's not important. That's not the point. We're trying to make We're just trying to kind of make fun of people You can craft anything you want as long as it's one of the half dozen weapons in the game And that was also When you have a short sentence that people can share and that's Interesting in some way it can be funny, but it doesn't have to be I know that everyone doesn't make farm animal simulators but you can as long as it's something that's short and kind of Shareable then it goes out so much easier than when you try to do something like you know Do we have we have 44 maps? What's what's 44 maps? How large is a map? How long does it take to play a map is it like a? Super Meat Boy map that takes 10 seconds, or is it like do you play for hours? It doesn't tell you very much but when you have a short message that people can relate to and that they can share with each other then it's so much easier to Reach out to people and it's so much easier to you know gather them at one place And that was also really that worked really well, right? I'm gonna talk more about Reddit later because it's been really big help for us So basically you know the best press release Is as short as possible one sentence about the game Feature list press kit. There's nothing else you need maybe a quote from you That would make a good headline and I've learned that you shouldn't try too hard to make press excited about to get your game because I think the truth is that press Is I'm sure that press people are excited about games, but they see you know They get like a hundred press releases a day, and it's They can't be excited about every single game So it's better to just give them something that's easy that they can copy paste and just put it on their site Something that's fast Rather than trying to you know sell them or win them over in some way I'll say something about youtubers a lot of people ask me about you know, how does how does youtubers fit into this? I think youtubers aren't isn't anything isn't related to PR There's nothing you can say to a youtuber that will make him want to play your game if he doesn't find it interesting Especially the big ones. I mean PewDiePie is like you know he doesn't care. He has 40 million subscribers. You know You can't be like oh, you know. I'll give you I give you a steam code Yes, you know he can buy all the games on Steam that he wants I think if you want get youtubers to play your game, then you that's a game design question It has nothing to do with marketing It has nothing to do with PR when people play your game on YouTube it helps your marketing and PR But it's nothing that you can as a PR manager that's That can't be your responsibility because that should be the game designers responsibility to not only make a game That's fun to play, but also make a game. That's fun to watch when someone is playing it So we noticed that most of our community seemed to gather on Facebook we got like 80,000 likes first couple of weeks on sanctum we had like 20,000 likes for years and we tried so hard to increase them We'd go simulated. We just got like a ton of people in just a couple of days So it was it was obvious say you know we need to put more energy into Facebook, and we need to you know Make it it became our main channel communication because you know even journalists would follow us So there's and sometimes when I if I write something on Facebook. It'll end up as an article anyway So you know we realized early on that we need to focus on Facebook Now how Facebook works, I'm sure like if you work in marketing and stuff like that You know how Facebook works, but I'm gonna explain it fast anyway Basically updates are always tested on a small group if you have a hundred thousand followers on Facebook, and you write something That doesn't get pushed to a hundred thousand people because You know we all like 150 different Facebook pages if all of them would update every day We wouldn't be able to see anything else Facebook would be full of ads so basically what they want to do Well Facebook wants you to do is to filter out all the bad updates and push out all the good ones So what they do is they try They test an update on a small group like a hundred or a thousand people If the update has good Engagement like likes shares comments, then it's pushed out to a slightly larger group if it still works And it's pushed out to a larger group again So it's strictly strictly controlled by Facebook, which is a good thing Reddit is basically a really really big Facebook page Where everyone updates everything and you can control What goes up there? But it's still it still follows the same kind of Idea where you let the users and the interest that the users have in what you write You let that control how many more people see it because on the front page of reddit are only the The updates that have had the you know the most upvotes most engagement and stuff like that So That you know that's how the system works, but usually Marketing people stop there. They never look at how people work You know that's half the equation too We like to share things on Facebook to impress our friends We all want to be you know that funny person that has the best cat videos You know the most interesting articles about whatever it is and that's why you always that's what cats are more viral than anything else because You know you just rather share a cute picture of a cat Than patch notes to a game You know if you play Call of Duty and Call of Duty releases a New gun and you have 300 friends on Facebook. Maybe two of them play Call of Duty So that's only relevant to two of your friends And you're gonna look like a nerd to the rest of them and your grandma is gonna be like what you know Why is arming sharing? Pictures of guns, what's he gonna do? so You know that's why things that everyone can appreciate are always Much much more viral than things that you know only a small amount of people can appreciate So if you know if you're gonna run a Facebook page you can't just think of your fans But you need to think of your the friends of your fans you need to think you know are my are my fans gonna Look like idiots if they share this update especially when it comes to things like Here's here's concept art to our game can everyone like and share it, please Then that gives no incentive to people to actually like and share it and it just looks like you're you know Trying too hard to make people market your game, and you're kind of trying to turn your Your followers into you know marketers, and I people don't appreciate that So I have I've been doing with our Facebook updates for two years now and I'm gonna do some comparisons in in What are what were our best posts and what were our worst posts, and what can we learn from that? We worked on a With a company that made shirts for us because people were like oh, where can I buy a goat simulator shirt? So we we had made some art We made a couple of mugs and you know small stuff like that And we thought that it was gonna be really big like people are gonna go crazy or this But when we updated when we pushed it to our Facebook it got very very little people even saw it Very little people people even thought that it was relevant to engage in We I think back then we had maybe a hundred thousand likes on Facebook and as you can see it only got out to 15,000 people Well, I don't know why I have some theories it could be because You know the game is $10 the merch is like $25 plus shipping So that instantly removes like 90% of all our players anyway It's you know it's nothing that you want to share on your Facebook. It's like September 9th Maybe you just started high school. Maybe you just started college You know all the cute people in your class are gonna go to your Facebook page And they're gonna see some shirt with a goat on it. It's kind of weird So it's nothing you know we gain a lot if you share this, but you don't gain anything from sharing this yourself We run a competition. We had a We added the steam workshop to the game Because we wanted people to make mods and make extra content and we want to have to you know have a community that was kind of alive So we did a competition where we we would let players Make maps and then we would judge them, and you know the best one would win something cool and It was more successful than our shirt campaign Probably because it was free But one thing that was You know To our detriment was probably that it's not something that everyone can do it's not something that everyone has wants to do It's not something that everyone has time to do even so it wasn't we got like I think We got a dozen or so submissions but it still took us like Took us some time to play through the maps there was like this administration Cost to it where we had to Still had to do some things for this to work And and in the end it was good But we didn't get that much results that we we hoped like we all we had people were like oh You know everyone's gonna start making Goat Simulator maps now But it's not really Wasn't really how it worked This picture got 90,000 views and like 330 shares this was right when the video released their new graphics card and They're actually goat towers like this actually this is actually a thing Sometime around like the 1700s 1800s in Ireland they had a ton of goats apparently And they I guess they thought that the goats they wanted to do something that looked good So they built towers and let goats climb up in them as a decoration basically for rich people in the United Kingdom So I found this picture. I think someone sent me this picture And I just put it up on our Facebook page and people thought it was really funny. We got like 6,000 likes Compared to what was the other like a couple of hundred likes? We got a ton of shares And you know if you click the share button you see what people wrote when they shared it and everyone was like ha ha look At this you know they wanted to show this to their friends because it was pretty funny This is our worst update ever Patch notes for the mobile version of the game Terrible probably because only a fraction of our users play mobile. We have the game on Steam on Xbox on PlayStation, so it's only interesting for a small part of our players anyway And there's there's there's nothing you can say it can be like oh yay Maybe you pull out your mobile and and they download it, but there's nothing really why would I want to share this on my Facebook page? This got like 145,000 people reached Two letters two letter updates one picture. I was playing as there's a I think this is called Giant goat or like fish goat or something like that It's a blue whale you can't even control it You can just like roll around because you don't have any legs And I got stuck like in a I was gonna jump into the pool But I got stuck right next to there, and I thought it was a funny picture So I took it I put it up on our Facebook page And you know people thought it was really funny, and they shared it, and I think it got up on reddit as well This is our most viral Facebook post ever that we've ever done. There's not even any text. It's just a picture I didn't even it didn't even make this this picture. I found it on Google or something 9,000 shares If you're gonna buy advertisements on Facebook on Pop-up ads whatever you're gonna do Half a million reach is pretty expensive, right? It's like you end up paying like a couple of hundred or a couple of thousand dollars for it If you're gonna do it like a campaign to push your game to that many people This was like two minutes of work. This was like literally Haha, that's funny drag-and-drop to desktop drag-and-drop to Facebook update And because it's it's a funny thing to share, right? So that was that was really successful for us So basically what I learned from Facebook is that and this applies as like I told you this applies to Reddit this applies to really any social media out there and social media is growing like crazy People don't share or comment things that make them look stupid. There's no reason you want to share, you know, patch notes to a game about goats on your on your Facebook page. What do your friends have to gain from that? I think it's important as a marketing person to use your common sense, to not like stare yourself blind on the numbers and you know try to impress your bosses too much. People want to share funny things, people don't want to share commercials. Other updates that are really terrible are when our games on a sale, like GoTimulator is on a 75% off sale. No one clicks on that. You might tab out and go on Steam and buy the game, but you're never gonna share that to your friends. People don't like being, you know, walking commercials. So I think it's really important to entertain your people, you know, create an environment that people want to be part of. You know how Apple has, what are they called, Apple bars? You know, the Apple things where you go with your computer and they're always like so nice. Their customer service is, it's basically like a party, right? Like Apple stores are like a party and they make it a party that you want to go to and that's something that you should think about when you make social media as well. Make your website or a Facebook page or whatever it is, make it a cool party that people want to visit instead of, you know, forcing people to share things for you. This is my saddest slide. How is media today? I think media today is really terrible. It hasn't really changed since mass marketing was invented a hundred years ago. It's still built on obsolete technology. I don't know how often I get emails that are like, you know, do you want to buy ad space on a building in a city somewhere in the US and we're, you know, we're situated in Sweden anyway or like do you want to buy ads on a train and it's not really, you know, it's not really something that our customers are going to see anyway. Basically, you know, a lot of people that are on trains are going to see it but it's not something that is relevant for us at all. What developers do is that they use pre-written responses everywhere. You know, you write something to a Facebook page and they're like thank you for your feedback, Jack. We will take it into consideration. We're really glad that you like our game and that's, you know, if you're gonna write that you might as well not answer at all. And developers either put PR professionals between themselves and the players. That's usually what the large companies do, the companies that have the money. The companies that don't have the money, like indie developers, they just ignore their fans completely because they're so scared of, you know, I'm gonna say something stupid, people are gonna hate me or they just don't know what to answer at all. I had, when we made the MMO expansion, we were looking for suggestions from our fans. So I wrote this update, you know, what would you want to do? What would you want us to update Goat Simulator with? And the responses that we got were terrible. It's like you can't use them. Lasers, what am I gonna do with lasers? Or like squirrel diving suits? How can that be an expansion even? So I just started, you know, making fun of the suggestions, kind of. It was a Monday, I was sitting, you know, down with my coffee and I was like, you know, holy shit people are stupid and someone's gonna quote me on that. Fuck. Anyway, I was just, you know, kind of chatting with them, you know, not making fun of them that much, a little bit, but like, you know, playing around, being playful. And I noticed that we got so many, so much more engagement. Like, you know, I would get more likes on my comments than on the actual, you know, thing that I updated. And people started, like, you know, tagging their friends. They're like, oh look what they're doing, like, you know, their Facebook page guy is drunk. And, you know, it kind of became a thing, which was really fun. This was, like, also one of our most viral posts. I don't know how much this is worth, how many hundreds of dollars in marketing this is worth, but it was really, really successful for us. So when you do something that works, you want to keep doing it, right? So I noticed, you know, casual interaction really increases engagement so much with people. They see you're playing and they want to comment as well, of course. You know, they, someone writes something stupid, I reply with something stupid, so people are like, oh, can I, I'm gonna say something even more crazy. And I think, basically, you know, interacting with your community is so much better than trying to manage them in some way. I think there's basically three types of comments. There are comments that aren't very useful, like the ones that you guys just saw. There are toxic comments, you know, people that want to kill you because you've made a freaking gay man, and actually useful suggestions, but those are really rare, though. So during Sanctum 2, I did the thing that I just said that you shouldn't do, which is ignore every single comment that wasn't, I love Sanctum 2, I can't wait, and then I just reply, thanks, or smiley, you know. I would play it really safe because I was really new at marketing and I was like, I don't want to start a Twitter storm, I don't want people to, you know, get mad at me. But in Goat Simulator, I basically interact with them as I would interact with them in real life. So if you would walk up to me and you should, you say that I should give away my work for free, this is exactly how I would reply to your comment. And that really, you know, initially I was like, I replied and then I checked back in like two minutes and I'm like, you know, has something bad happened? Has it exploded? It didn't. And then, you know, it would just end up getting more and more likes and people would just laugh. And, you know, even, of course I'm not, I mean, I'm writing in caps lock, of course I'm not angry. We were just playing around and, you know, people would find it funny and even the people I would kind of make fun of would just, you know, be really in on it and they would think that it's funny. I decided that I'm going to reply to every single comment, even if it's totally pointless. If you write something pointless, maybe you just want someone to answer, maybe you just want to be seen for a while. Like David, he just needs a hug, you know, and a relaxing cup of hot chocolate. So, dealing with toxicity, that's the hardest part, of course. It's easy to make fun of, you know, people that are, you know, happy and making fun of themselves a little bit. With Sanctum 2, we just ignored it. We had, like, once one of our programmers was, like, wrote something. It was, like, I don't remember what it was, but he just wrote a comment and people were, like, you know, if you reply to a toxic comment, you just get, like, a hundred toxic comments back. People just, like, there's no shortage of angry people on the internet and as soon as you reply, you just attract them, you know, even more. So, we would just, like, ignore every single toxic comment, but we would still be kind of afraid because we were, like, what if I delete this comment that tells me that I should go kill myself? Is that censorship? Are people gonna get mad? Are we gonna get, you know, raided by even more goons that come over here and harass us even more? So, you were, like, kind of, you know, you're really scared. You weren't really, didn't really know how you were gonna handle it, but Goat Simulator is, you can talk shit back as much as you want, as long as you're funny doing it, because I think there's a really big difference between, you know, when someone attacks you and you wrestle them down to the ground and roll around in the mud like an idiot and when, you know, someone attacks you and you just deflect and make fun of them. So, you know, the way you answer is really, really important, especially, you know, as long as you're funny and you don't even have to meet their criticism if their criticism is really angry and, you know, really toxic. Here's a bunch of toxic comments. Basically, you know, if you're gonna come to my Facebook page and talk shit, then you, you know, if you deal it, you gotta be able to take it yourself. You know, Jeffrey comes to my page, talks shit about my mom. I'm gonna get him back. Steven guy to the top right, this update that provoked Steven so much was that we had ported the game to Mac and we were like, okay, Goat Simulator is on Mac now. You can play it on Mac and Steven is like, oh my god, I'm so angry. How can you do this? They don't deserve this game and you're like, if you just burst their bubble, then they realize that they're being idiots, right? Because some of them, we've all been 12, right? I remember when I played Warcraft 3 on my old computer and you beat someone and you're like, haha, you suck. And basically, if you act like that, you just need someone to, you know, sit you down and be like, okay, is this, is this really worth getting angry over? Is this really something you should be upset over, you know? And when I wrote this, it was, these were like some of our biggest updates as well. Like, if one person is toxic to you and you make fun of them, you're gonna get like 10 people that agree with you that are gonna start making fun with them too. Like, people would like write, write comments under it and be like, oh, you got burned, man, you know? So, you're allowed to talk shit as long as you're funny. There's, you know, this update was really unnecessary and I replied and, you know, someone put it up on Reddit and as you can see under there, 541,000 views. That's also hundreds or thousands of money in marketing. Just, you know, Ethan really helped us out, you know? Just by, you know, commenting back to people, replying when people thought, there's no way he thought that we were gonna reply to that and then we did and people thought that was really funny. And, you know, it saves you a lot of marketing costs. This is all the top posts about Goat Simulator. Usually it takes around, when we released Goat Simulator, it took around 3,000 to 4,000 upvotes to get featured on the front page. Now it's more like 5,000 or 6,000 because Reddit has really grown a lot. But, you know, this is totally free marketing. I said that I was gonna talk more about Reddit. I, myself, never update anything on Reddit because I think Reddit is kind of like, it's its own community. They have, you know, their own type of talking. They have their own memes and stuff like that. It's kind of like going to a party and selling steak knives, you know? You know those things and people are enjoying themselves and you're like, why don't you buy these things? Why don't you buy my things? And everyone's just gonna get angry at you and everyone's gonna know that you're that developer that keeps coming to Reddit gaming and keeps pushing your stupid game on us. So I think this is also a thing where you should just try to make fun content and if you do that then people will find it. Reddit, as you know, they have eyes everywhere. If you do something funny they're gonna find it, they're gonna put it up on Reddit and if it's funny enough it's gonna get upvoted. There's no reason that you should, as a developer, try to like do commercial for your company on Reddit. Last notes and tips. We're gonna do questions. I intentionally saved 15 minutes so that we can do, you guys can ask and we can discuss things. So I hope you thought about questions so far. But first I'm gonna go through the last tips. If you're gonna go away with something in this talk then I would say that you should remember to, when you do marketing, produce content that people want to share. Don't just produce content that you earn something from. Make things that your fans earn something from sharing it as well. Create a cool party on the internet that people want to go to instead of creating a huge billboard of marketing and screenshots of your game. And I think it's really important to stand out in every single way that you possibly can. Now again, I know that everyone isn't making a game about goats so it doesn't always have to be stand out in a funny way. Although I think games could be way more funny than they are. I think people are way too serious in the games industry. But basically doing something that people don't expect is always going to get you more attention than doing what everyone else is doing. Because if you have a crowd of people, like if you have a hundred marketing people, everyone's like banging cans and pots and yelling about their game. If you just, you know, wear a pink suit and stand there then everyone's eyes are gonna get drawn to you. Yes, questions please. We have microphones over there. Line up and let's do questions. Hi, I'm making a game about mice so that's kind of similar. We have a Facebook page that has 1.6 million likes. How did you get that much? The game is six years old. Did you buy them? No. But we have a problem with our Facebook page. It's that it's very scattered between many many languages and I see all the updates are in English. But when we post something on Facebook we have like 200 comments that are in 20 different languages and it's really hard to reply to them all in a witty way. So how do you manage that? We just don't do that. Yeah. You don't have any comments in other languages than English? No, I've actually, it doesn't happen. I guess that Goat Simulator kind of became big with youtubers and there's a lot of like YouTube fans that come on our on our page and I don't have a good response to that question I'm sorry you could you could do things that aren't text maybe like do more screenshots instead of like language updates yeah that's exactly what we do we always post an image with no text on it that just explains what we want to do but on Facebook recently released a feature that lets you post in one post in two different languages and it's really recently like it's like two weeks ago but we used to make one status for every language before and that Richard really poor so much work though yeah so much work and it scatters the comments a lot so people don't see the the post it doesn't have many comments so they don't engage with it so it's kind of harder I didn't try Google Translate even if it doesn't make any sense even if you sound like an idiot it's not a big deal I think okay thanks thank you I'm sorry I couldn't answer it better hi hello nice talk you mentioned that Facebook was your main like a venue to to get to the fans and how you feel about like the website do you have to have the website just the basic stuff or because a lot of developers try to update the website then update the Facebook post then Twitter and stuff and just it's so much work so how do you feel about you know the games website or just the studio website honestly I think our studio website is more for people that you know want to apply to work with us they want to know more about coffee stain as a studio I think it's so much easier for people to go on Facebook because most everyone's on Facebook and it's just you know you always saw a Facebook tab in your phone up you always you subscribe so much easier to subscribe to information on Facebook than be like you know take out your calendar and write like every Saturday remember to check their website for new information so I basically think you I think you just scatter your fans if you have them on two different places and you suggest you just put in a link to your Facebook page on your website and then just if you want to post or info just go to Facebook yeah or and do like one of those things where you you get a small screenshot of the latest update that you had on Facebook on your website so that people can you know get an update without you having to update two things every time you do something thanks for the talk is really good I really like the voice that you have you know when you're interacting with your fans on the goat simulator page and I wonder if you know when you guys come out with your next game that's not I mean it fits really perfectly with the goat simulator brand and if you come out with like sanctum three or something that's like more serious how would you adjust that voice on the Facebook page for sanctum three as opposed how would you apply these lessons to something that's more serious that's a really good question if you look at I saw you know civilization beyond earth and they have it's a sci-fi game and of course they have a ton of sci-fi fans on their on their page so they update things like articles like you know when they found like gravitational waves they put it up on Sid Meier's civilization beyond earth and they got like so many shares from that because their fans are really interested in space stuff right because you play a space game so I think you can definitely you know it doesn't only have to be funny things you can do like they're doing it if you have a game that's about being a cowboy right like a cowboy you know right like an astronaut or something like that you know make it something different than just you know thanks for playing our game please you know tell all your friends thanks hi thank you very much for the talk is really good I thought you did a great job branding goats in my questions talked a little bit about reddit and obviously I think it's really good advice not to use it as a commercial tool but in terms of an engagement tool how often do you interact with fans on reddit and you know what you one other thing you mentioned something that I work on in my role is getting devs to talk to players you know what have you done to kind of have your devs out there a little bit more and did you have them go to reddit or just Facebook or anywhere else I read already threads but I don't I don't reply ever I think I did it like the first couple of times but it's like as soon as you apply you get like a hundred people who are like oh I have a suggestion why don't you make a bird simulator instead why don't you make you know my mom really likes dogs can't you make a game that has like her dog that looks like her dog she'll be really happy you know you get this so much spam and you tell them oh you know can't you guys go to our Facebook ask me those things there and they're like stop marketing your Facebook on our page so I read all of them there's there's an app that you can get that basically whenever someone writes goat simulator anywhere on the internet and and you know on a reddit or whatever I get a an email with a link to the site so every time there's a reddit thread about goat simulator I see it I read through it but I you know I don't comment on it if they want to talk with me go to our Facebook page thank you very much this is a really good talk we're localizing a game that's a kind of like a very off-the-wall style like it's basically a rail shooter meets dating sim called a gal gun that we're bringing over to the West and it has thank you as it's got that kind of very ridiculous sort of marketing style to it as well but you guys it's an amazing engagement on your Facebook page but I'm wondering like do you guys use Twitter very much and how you utilize that Avenue as well not that much we use personal Twitters so you follow us on Facebook if you want to know about the you know the brand goat simulator but if you want to know more about our employees and you follow us on our personal Facebook our personal Twitter pages and you know on Facebook I maybe update you know once every other day on Twitter you can do whatever you want like you know update every day post you know pictures of your food or whatever I think Twitter should more be you people want to follow people on Twitter and brands on Facebook I think okay so you guys don't utilize Twitter really for goat simulator stuff like you do on Facebook really we have a coffee stain Twitter where we write you know if we release something we wrote on the right on coffee stain Twitter but I you know I update that maybe once or twice a month when we have something to say we update on Twitter because otherwise there's not much you can do what there's not much you can write on Twitter and it's only 144 characters and most people miss what you tweet anyway because there's so much more noise on Twitter than on Facebook okay great thank you do you have a rule of thumb for how often you need to post and maybe you don't have this problem but if you don't have anything interesting to say is it best not to say anything it's that's so hard it's basically when I have something fun in mind I post it I try to post every other every third day if we're releasing something new if we have like you know we have a bunch of new screenshots or gifs that we want to show off then I could post every day but I think there's a risk in you know being saying something just for the sake of saying it and I think that kind of just makes you look a little bit lame and boring so you know update as often as you can as long as it's good things so we're making a game called chicken and it's not spelt right it's kind of weird and it's like you build creatures with blocks so we got picked up with our tech demo by the YouTube community and like PewDiePieJack played it and it happened very organically and since October we got like 20 million views on all of those let's play videos but now we're about to release an early access and we're getting like very rigid and thinking about this release so do you think we should let our YouTube community pick it up again organically by buying it or reach out to them cuz I know you said don't give PewDiePie a key like if he could get it he can get it himself so we're wondering if we should be like reaching out like nudging or just let it go you can definitely like there's nothing you don't lose anything in reaching out I said that mostly because there's a lot of people that are like oh you know I emailed PewDiePie my key but he hasn't replied I don't know why and you know he gets a hundred people emailing him things every day and he probably doesn't read the emails himself it's probably like some agent of his or stuff like that so I think yeah try to reach out try to just let them know that you're still releasing the game and the main tip try to be sure try to make them put up their video when you really when you've already to release your game or like when you've one day ahead of releasing your game because otherwise people are gonna see it but they're gonna forget about it like there that's what we had with Goat Simulator we had people started making clones on friggin iOS before before our PC version was out there was like Goat 3d simulator on iOS and they would get so many downloads when PewDiePie made his video because they would look for Goat Simulator on on the App Store and this that's what they would have found so I think when a video goes out you got a ton of people looking for your game and it's really good if your game is available then so give them like give them a key the day the week of launch you're saying yeah something like that cool thanks a lot just to follow on what they mentioned on Twitter or Facebook do you have like you have of course web Facebook page for Goat Simulator but for your other games you use like Facebook page for each of your games or will be better to just have one for like Coffee Stain and then have a change when you know depending on the game you're launching at the time when I started working at Coffee Stain we had a Facebook page for Sanctum so it's just been natural for us to make a new Facebook page for new games I don't know if that's the right way to go I hope so but you know you can try it and you know give me an email and tell me what you think is better I don't know yeah I don't know myself but I think I think you know it's not it's probably not a big deal in the end the most important thing is just that you make good updates and then everything else will work out just focusing on the in the game at the moment right yeah thanks hi there so a few years ago like our the game we're making right now just sort of went mildly viral and you know originally we got you know taken by surprise and we what's her it's called castle story is on early access right now I bought that sweet thank you but you know we got taken by surprise and we sort of redirected everybody on our company's Facebook page and you know like we got like something like 25,000 likes right now I think but just feels like it's sort of has a limited scope the possibility of growing because it's like completely unrelated to the game itself so do you think like how do you feel about that like the fact that you know basically should we start from scratch and make it like a castle story Facebook page and you know how many how many followers do you have 20,000 I think at the moment but not on it's on on the company page it's not on them like we don't even update the game page so what are your thoughts on that it's it's it's a hard question I don't know I think there's there's a point in having your the name of your game always be showing because that what we had with them you know the share this goat for no reason and then it would it would just say goat simulator share this go for no reason and that's really good but it's like half a million people see your brand and that's good so that's the good thing about having a page just for your game but the bad thing is that later when you release a new game you split up your community again kind of the same answer as the other guy I don't know what's best maybe you can find out and then you can tell me all right we'll do thanks I was just I think the last question because otherwise they're gonna get angry at me I have a short one I was just curious what app you use to find promoter app okay it's really good yeah use it I think it's like $100 a year or something it's really cheap yeah all right thanks a lot for coming guys it's been a lot of fun
