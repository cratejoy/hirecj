What's going on everyone? It's Connor Sutherland here. I'm one of the co-founders of Kensington Media House We are a performance marketing agency specializing in email and SMS marketing for e-commerce brands generated over 12 million dollars in email attributable revenue and Today what I'm going to show you guys is our email copywriting framework How we actually write emails to be persuasive to be engaging to be entertaining to make Customers want to continue opening up your emails Now I will say I do have something to sell you if you are an e-commerce brand doing over $50,000 a month in Shopify revenue. I do have a no-brainer offer for you guys at the end, but I'll leave that for the end We'll actually go into the guide first. And then yeah, if you're not one of those I have nothing to sell you. So You have six core weapons in your arsenal to use an email copywriting, right? So this all comes from Robert Cialdini's book influence. If you have not read that definitely give it a read It's an excellent book. So we have reciprocity commitment inconsistency social proof authority liking and scarcity is the last one so we're gonna go into how to actually Use all of these in terms of from from a principles perspective, but then also from a practical I suppose tactics based perspective with examples of these all being used in action, so Essentially don't send shit emails, right? I don't send things that are boring Don't be selling constantly like, you know have a reason to contact people, but don't get me wrong You can manufacture a reason to contact people if your copywriting skills are good enough But I'm just saying don't send bad emails to your list because that's it's actually probably worse than not sending an email at all in many respects, so The other thing is commitment and consistency. So What we're gonna do in terms of email, you know for e-commerce brands is segment based on the interest level of buyer Clicker multiple-time browser and then speak to that accordingly So we want to you know, be very relevant to the buyer to the buyer themselves in terms of the messaging that we have Social proof show reviews where you've been featured, you know your trust pilot rating influencers who endorse you etc, etc Authority so as seen in if professionals endorse you that kind of thing liking so use a character in your emails use some humor and Scarcity here directly call out if you have low inventory levels use countdown timers where applicable, you know These will all work quite well. So we're gonna go in in a bit more depth to each one of these So remember I said don't send shit emails if a brand is constantly annoying you every time they contact you Would you want to buy from them? Like definitely not you probably wouldn't even want to be on their list you would unsubscribe after a very short period of time so you don't want to be that brand and The kind of rule of thumb that we would have is that in your kind of content calendar look at it Like your bank account if you're selling you're withdrawing from your bank account if you're brand building Sending good content. That's actually useful in terms of how to use the products better. For example You're adding to your bank account. You're you're lodging money into that So a good rule of thumb is four out of every five times when you're looking at your calendar You probably want to be using content campaigns and then have a direct sales email one time out of five Now in different periods, let's say you're having a sale. Let's say it's q4. It's around Black Friday this goes out the window a bit, but you know for For nine to ten months of the year, this is a really really good kind of framework to follow Content based campaigns the myth about your industry showing off good press so like an example of this that we did for a fashion client of ours was They're a high fashion client like their average order value is like seven hundred dollars We realize like with a lot of high fashion brands They actually get things made like they actually get their products made in northern Africa get it shipped to Italy get the label put in in Italy and Then say made in Italy and like legally that's actually allowed even though the the product wasn't really made there And so all of their stuff is made in Italy like fully from scratch with silk with cashmere lovely materials It's really like did you know here's the myth about the industry like these people don't actually make their products in Italy But we do like that's a very interesting email. There's no discounts and Like it printed money for them. So that's a good that's a good example of like the myth about your industry Here's something everyone else does we don't do that and you kind of virtue signal a little bit in terms of your brand Showing off good press. That's a really good one So let's say you've got good articles about you and Forbes and Vogue and goop birdie some of these kind of publications Showing off user-generated content people enjoying your products Showing that hey look these are real people enjoying your products at the end of the day specific product features, so Let's say you can go into your Shopify analytics and you can find Kind of products with high potential in terms of they don't have that many You know visits and onto the actual product page, but they have a high conversion rate You could show those off as kind of hidden gems for instance. So a product feature like that Which product is right for you a quiz? So this is interesting We've seen this work better with with let's say in beauty like it's kind of like what kind of a person are you you know so This works really well So if you're this kind of person this product works well for you for this kind of person this product works well for you And it's engaging. It's fun So that's what that's those are some good examples of content-based campaigns now when selling you want to be rotating offers in different segments So buyers or non-buyers primarily Those would be like the main two Or buyers of certain collections, you know, that would be another one Recent buyers as well Maybe you might exclude those from your selling campaigns if someone's bought in the last three days or seven days even you might want to exclude those but Here are kind of offers that you can kind of rotate So you're looking at a percentage off probably the most common offer all of e-commerce dollar amount off funny fact is Five dollars off 50, even though it's 10% off might actually do better than 10% off or vice versa like drastically better it's like sometimes the exact same offer framed a different way can do a lot differently, which is Definitely kind of crazy to see Bundles so, you know if you bundle up if you get three of this of this kind of product you'll get you know A percentage off or something like that and it's funny if you're like a fashion brand or you're someone who doesn't want a discount Like let's say higher fashion because we work with a couple of these kind of brands Bundling making people reach for that discount is a good way of actually giving people an offer but not cheapening your brand So, you know even you'll see fashion brands saying hey buy three of this kind of expensive Product line for and you'll get 30% off even but it doesn't cheapen the brand. It's just an amazing offer You know, it's still your margins are really good there because you know, their AOV is so high. So Free gift will purchase another good one. This can perform really well and free shipping These would be some kind of offers to put to work with so that is pretty much reciprocity kind of in a nutshell Commitment and consistency so you want to be using your segments property if someone's a buyer talk about the feeling that how can they buy again if Someone is a lead talk about trying your brand So you you want to you want to basically like with without being creepy, right? Like without saying hey, we know like you did like we saw you browse six times We saw you had we saw you at Salmon for dinner yesterday as well You know, you don't be really really creepy, but you want to you want to speak to them as a person, right? So here's an example we did for a CBD brand So after they click and don't buy we actually like send them third-party lab testing So like it because because they click they show that they're interested, but they haven't yet bought So, you know, we hit them with their offer that they have for brides abandoned and like they get you know This is like building more and more trust so that would be an example of Segmenting based on the kind of interest level shown by the bar Social proof use testimonials like the one below as often as possible And what we've actually found is that the less polished it looks the better So it's very funny with email marketing people want the prettiest emails possible Oftentimes that's actually not what converts, you know, this just This looks very real, you know, it doesn't look ultra polished It's like here's this girl Amy who has commented on an Instagram post Saying that she loves this lotion that drives her husband insane. It's very real. It brings this, you know back down to earth rather than kind of these DTC darlings with sans-serif on some pastel colors with Everything looking too polished. It just doesn't something about it just doesn't feel raw and real, you know So here one of our clients Irv Smith jr Apparently a big NFL star. I'm from Ireland. So I'm I don't know all that much about American sports But yeah, he's apparently a big deal. I'm told so yeah using people like that leads to These having a lot of social proof Authority so make blocks like the ones below a fixture in your email template see here look at the publications were in Trustpilot excellent And then here like diffusing more objections with our footer like free UK delivery over 50 pounds you can exit livery Why never later free global delivery over a hundred pounds this kind of thing We're showing off authoritative figures. This isn't one of our clients. This is from a brand called disco, but You can see here. They have a doctor. Dr. Eva Simmons O'Brien. She might be a bit Irish as well. Who knows? So We like what they said showing off authority look at this person who vouches for our products You can do this throughout your emails. I mean, we're doing this for actually a brands a brand selling like consumable products But the founder has been in the space for like 20 years And you can use her as an authority figure or we can use her as an authority figure in the emails as in look how long The Katrina has been I don't have to watch this video, but We haven't agreed to put them in the video. But yeah, that's her name We can say is Katrina She's an authority figure because she's been in the space for so long. So So yeah, there we go. Just docks and clients here left right and center Liking so something else like using the liking if people actually like your brand if there's a bit of a personal feel to it They're gonna be far more likely to purchase and to just generally recommend you to friends to just enjoy the products To want to come back and purchase multiple times It's often times. He's a character and it's really funny to see this in action. It's so impactful The biggest the biggest thing as well is that when you sort of imagine yourself as a character that you're going to be And customers will be more likely to reply to your emails and getting replies People don't know this but it's phenomenal for your deliverability and send a reputation and people reply to your emails Also, if we have a character like here called Emma like when you when you're getting replies through gorgeous or You know as ndesk to hey, thanks Emma. Thanks for the email that kind of thing It kind of does make you laugh because you're like she's fictional Emma doesn't even know what she's talking about You can see how it drives more engagement because it makes it so like the brand isn't faceless, you know, it's like, okay There's like a person writing this. I mean there is a person writing this just not Emma, you know, so so yeah It gives that personal feel what we've also found. This is kind of funny, but using female characters seems to work better Just like quite a lot better So yeah, I think that's it. I hope you guys enjoyed this video. I'll see you guys in the next one Um Just like quite a lot better actually so only ever use female characters you can see hey emma from the Team here just want to drop in and let you know that you're that our something sale is ending tonight Now is your last chance to get up to 30 off selected products. You can shop the collection here Thank you for all the support and we'll talk soon. Emma It's getting blocking out the client name here um scarcity, so Use genuine scarcity and don't lie. It's actually insanely powerful So you got to be a bit wise like as in? You don't want to be constantly using scarcity because it is something that can kind of burn out your audience a bit as well so It's kind of it's it's the reason I have it last is because it's by far the most powerful out of the six Nothing gets humans to move quite like scarcity um So I remember seeing a brand called sternucci Um big jewelry brand out of the uk and I bought from them like three or four times Um, really good brand they had Uh an email I forget it was recent enough where they said they'd only made like a hundred of a certain new drop they had and I know the scale of the brand and I just Not to like call them out but I know it wasn't a hundred units that they made of this product like it just couldn't be because like the the brand's doing I don't know probably 50 million pounds a year or something like that. So Yeah, um They're like you you want to be careful with how you use it. So here you can see a countdown timer You know, like the basically you're it's ending at midnight tonight like the or Yeah, like it's ending ending soon. It should be once a day six hours 56. So I shouldn't say ends at midnight tonight. Um, but Yeah, you can see I'm using countdown timers to to have scarcity Um directly call out being low on stock like the image below You know only a few left. Um, like you can see here like 1872 that like, you know Like literally saying here how many bottles we have left? Um 1872 seems like it seems like a lot so i'd probably say a few less if possible Um, so those are the six six things that we do So so basically with scarcity use kind of countdown timers call out low inventory levels say when things are ending So you've only made this amount with a new product drop etc, etc So to summarize you have reciprocity commitment and consistency social proof authority liking and scarcity And that's really it for the video guys Now, like I said if you're an e-commerce brand doing over fifty thousand dollars a month in revenue We will guarantee an increase in revenue or we will pay you So if you want to schedule your free clavio wallet, I have left this link down in the description of the video below If you enjoy the video, please like please comment, please subscribe share it with people if you found it interesting And I will be back I'll upload every monday and every friday on this channel So keep an eye out for those uploads if you want to learn more about econ email and sms.
