All right, good afternoon everybody. One quick reminder, turn off your phone, and then listen to me, and then turn your phone back on, and rate me. I don't make the rules, I just follow them. That's all I do. Okay, so this is my talk. I'm just going to call it email lists. That's what I wanted to call it, but I knew nobody would want to show up, so thank you so much for attending this talk that sounds so boring. So I really commend all of you for showing up. I swear, I love this stuff. It's really fun. I hope you like it just as much as I do. Okay, so I'm going to start the story, Halloween 1989. That's me. I'm nine years old. My mom made my tunic, and I'm Link, if you didn't guess, and my dad made my shield and my boomerang. I was a total Nintendo kid growing up. I was almost a brand representative. My Bible was Nintendo Power, and this is actually my original Nintendo Power, the one. I would just pour a big old bowl of cereal in the morning, and then just spread that magazine open and play my Nintendo all day, and let me tell you, I loved it. It inspired my early artistic abilities. Like I actually noticed that I made her arm jet out. It was an artistic interpretation of Samus. It wasn't a straight-up copy, but I grew up and I became a UX designer, and I like to study how people use technology, what they find interesting about it, what they don't like about it. I also make my own games. My latest one is the top left one, One Screen Platformer. It's a platformer that takes place on one screen. I also write about marketing. I tell you how to market a game on my website, howtomarketagame.com. I try and keep things super dead simple, guys. Okay. So I tried to fit it all down to 25 minutes. They only gave me 25 minutes for this talk. I couldn't do it. So you can get the director's cut of these slides at howtomarketagame.com.gdc2019. All the slides are up there, even more. And you also get a free book if you go there. I'm serious. You'll get my free book. But now that I know all about marketing and technology and how to make a game, it occurs to me that Nintendo Power is just a giant advertisement targeting, like, the 6-year-old to 16-year-old demographic. And I was marketed to my whole life with this book. And you might say, like, God, this guy's life is a lie. And no, it wasn't. It was, like, one of the best times of my life. And what I want to show you today is how to, like... The reason that it was so good was they weren't always marketing to you. They were along for the ride. Like, they enjoyed the stuff as much as I did. Like, they loved video games just as much as I did. And so what I want to teach you today is how to market your game so that a 9-year-old would want to draw it. And, like, that's what I'm here for. And you can't distribute magazines financially viably anymore. But the next best thing is email marketing. And I'm going to tell you today how that's going to work. But before I can get to the fun stuff, I've got to start with the boring stuff, which is funnels. I love postmortems. I read them all the time. This is a failed postmortem that was on Reddit. And the guy on Reddit said... This is a commenter for this postmortem. He said... I thought they quietly canceled the project until I saw it on Steam the week it released. And you're thinking... Oh, in the apocalypse. There it is. In the apocalypse. But it's not. This is an age-old problem that we've been facing for hundreds of years. And this man, Elias St. Elmo Lewis, wrote about this problem and how to solve it, like, way before television or the Internet, radio, all of that. His theories really influenced marketing today. And his most important contribution is this. It's called a sales funnel. And the thing about the sales funnel is... If you follow nothing I say today, you have to learn this. This is the most important thing you can learn. Because it's kind of like gravity or evolution. Even if you don't believe it, you are affected by this thing. So basically what a sales funnel is, it's a mental model of how people interface with your product as they get down the funnel, as they learn about it. So it goes from awareness, to interest, to desire, to finally taking action, which is just buying your game. And I'm gonna kind of chart the progression of somebody's face using this other magazine from my childhood, which was Game Pro Mag. They use these characters to rate people. And the reason it's called a funnel is when somebody finds out about you, it's like they're being poured onto the top of the funnel, and they kind of trickle down to the bottom. And so I'm gonna just... The easiest way to explain it is actually just a story. So let's pretend this whole room, we're all together. This is about the team size of making a modern RTS, I believe. So we're all making an RTS together. And we are making this RTS for this person A. She's just somebody out there who doesn't know we exist. And she likes RTSs. She played them in her childhood and everything. But luckily, we got caught up by Kotaku, and they wrote a glowing preview of our game. We haven't released it yet. And she reads Kotaku every day, and she sees it. And so she becomes aware of our game. And she reads the article and clicks the link that's provided to our website, where she reads an FAQ, and she learns about that game. She realizes this is an RTS. It's just what I like. This is interesting. So she's now in the interest phase. She finds out on our FAQ that we have a Twitch stream. We stream three times a week on the money. And we talk about DPS, and what the units, and the strategies, and the maps. And she learns all about it. She watches it all the time. And she desires it now. She thinks about this game on her breaks, on her commute. She's like, this is my game. I desire it. I want this game. And then on the last day, before we go live, we do a 24-hour stream-a-thon. All of us buy matching suits, and we're doing something cool on the stream. Every half an hour, we say, go buy the game. Go buy the game. And because she knew us, she learned who we are, and she liked us, she went and bought it right away, day one. That's it. Checkpoint. The reason this worked so well was we had something for her at every level of the funnel. We had a little piece of marketing everywhere. We got her in the top with PR. Then we piqued her interest with our FAQ. We used Twitch to heighten the desire of the game. And then we had a launch stream to do the call to action to say, go buy it. Now, the most important thing is, everybody talks about visibility. Seeing somebody on Steam and then going buy the game right away doesn't happen. Nobody just sees it and buys it. It's like, the only time that happens is gum at the checkout aisle. And that thing costs $1, and it's covered in sugar. It's the only time somebody sees something and then buys it. Exposure does not equal sales. And that's exactly what happened here with this Reddit commenter on that failed postmortem. Basically, they knew about it, they heard about the game, and they followed it a little bit. But then the developers dropped off, and they didn't keep contact. And so this person just lost interest and never bought the game. And why you need to think in funnels is, this week, you are going to be bombarded with so much information, there's no way you could do it all. So what you should do is you should classify this information about where it lives on the funnel. Well, this is definitely a top-of-the-funnel type of advice, where this is bottom-of-the-funnel advice. It helps you just organize your marketing schemes. So we all know streamers and tweet a lot for the top. That's perfect top-of-the-funnel stuff. But what goes in the bottom here? What's the best way to do these bottom three funnel activities? What I'm actually going to show you is that email actually really fits this very well to do these bottom three. So let's get into the fun stuff. This is the good stuff. OK, let's go. All right. So first off, if you guys are streaming out the door, this is not spam. I'm not saying we all become spammers or something. Spam is totally different. This is from Wikipedia. Spam is unsolicited, where they just scrape your email address off a website, and then they send you tons of emails. And then hopefully, one person will accidentally give away their bank account, and then we steal all their money. That's spam. That is not what we're suggesting here. It's also not emailing the press. A lot of people confuse that. Yes, if you market to the press using email, that's just marketing. This is something totally different. This is where regular fans will join your mailing list, and it's all about consent. They choose to give you their email address, and you contact them. And then if they ever don't like your message, they can unsubscribe, and you just never, ever, ever contact them again. Again, it's all about permission. Sometimes this is called permission marketing, because they opt into your message. And typically, it's run on stuff like MailChimp, ConvertKit. These softwares are your typical mailing list providers. And you might say, OK, well, I use Twitter. I'm doing pretty much the same thing with Twitter. And so here's four reasons why email is so totally awesome and much better than social media. Number one is you are not dependent on a big corporation to talk to your followers. 25 years ago, these were the hottest websites for talking to your fans. And if you built up a huge following on here, you lost all your money and all that effort to build up a fan base. And if you think Facebook and Twitter are huge now and they're indestructible, they are highly toxic, and they have a very rough user base. And your following could turn out to be turned off by those controversial messages that are being put out there. And it's happening today. Tumblr just changed the way they censor images and the way they allow people to post stuff. People are fleeing Tumblr. And just today, I actually just added this slide. MySpace just deleted 12 years of music. Oops, through some database migration. What a dumpster fire of everybody's music that they posted on MySpace. Basically, don't let corporations control your fan base. You should do that. And you can do that through email marketing. Number two is, and this is counterintuitive, social media actually isn't good at getting your fans to act. OK, so a marketing research firm surveyed a whole bunch of different companies and how their outreach did. And they averaged all their different communications based on response rates. And the way this graph works is, if you theoretically had 2,000 followers on Twitter, 2,000 Facebook followers, 2,000 email list followers, and you just sent a message, how many of those people would actually see that message? On average, only 40 of those 2,000 would actually see it through Twitter, whereas email gets about 435. Again, this is an average. And you're thinking, well, that's general marketing. It's probably for insurance and stuff. These are video games. This is a young audience. They're engaged, technologically advanced. It's not going to affect video games. So I wanted to test this theory. I had the same thought. So I found this guy, Pixel Jam Games. Go check out his game, Dino Run 2. He ran a successful Kickstarter last year. And the cool thing about him, the reason that's so interesting is, he was so dedicated. He emailed his list and tweeted at the exact same time on the exact same day with the same call to action and the same images. The guy was like a machine. And going into his Kickstarter campaign, he had 24,000 Twitter followers and 16,000 email subscribers, almost half as many email subscribers. Just keep that in mind. So this is what happened. He emailed his list five times during his Kickstarter campaign. This is the first email. These are the number of clicks his messaging got. It's like an order of magnitude higher for email. And it just continues on from that way. This is throughout this campaign of all the emails and tweets that he sent. It's not even close. It's not like, hey, if you just add some emojis to that Twitter, it's going to really pop it up there. It's an order of magnitude lower, the number of clicks that he got from Twitter versus email. And number three, you just have more functionality. When you use Twitter, you're just barking out to all people at all levels of the funnel. Whereas email, you can control your message. And the best example of this is this indie studio called Butterscotch Shenanigans. They've released tons of games. And they had something really smart. Like, OK, Crashlands was a big hit for them. But they had tons of earlier games that were not as popular. So they had this brilliant idea. And what they did was they created this secret unlockable side quest where you could unlock characters from their old games in Crashlands. And what the idea was that it would encourage people to go get that other game. And of all the people that then they ran this experiment. And what they did was for everybody that found this hidden character, half they got an in-game notification that, hey, this character is from one of our other games. The other half of the audience, they emailed them. And this email was awesome. This email contained a description of who the character was, a description of the game that this character starred in, which was Quadruped's Rampage. And then at the very bottom, a link to go get it from the store. And what they found after this little experiment, an emailed player was 2.8 times more likely to go get the game. And what happens is you're basically taking somebody from the bottom of the funnel of one game and just transfusing it like blood over to game B. Like that, you don't have to worry about getting top of the funnel, moving them all the way down. It's a lot easier to move an existing fan over to your next game. And number four is real simple. I'm just going to go through this real fast. Install base, like everybody's got email. You actually need an email address to sign up for Twitter and for Facebook and for Steam. Everybody's got an email address. There's no way they can say, well, I don't use Twitter or something. OK, so I know I'm pitching for email here, but it sounded pretty good for email. Like, there's a lot going on in email's column here. I'll give virality to social media. But remember, virality is a very top of the funnel thing. It's like, even if you get tons of exposure, everybody's retweeting it, they're still just at the top of the funnel. They haven't found interest in your game yet. And we're all game designers here. And what's a dominant strategy? It's that thing where it's that awesome sword that all players go to just because it's so overpowered. Email is that overpowered dominant strategy. And we don't get a lot of breaks as indies. And when we get just a little bit of a break, we should double down on it. So let me show you how to actually use it and take advantage of this. And the way you do it is you actually should treat email like it's your fan club. Your biggest fans should be on your email list, and you should treat them like the prince and princesses that they are. So a basic three-step process to work your email address. You drive traffic to your list. You build a relationship with that list. And then you market your game. So let's drive traffic to this list. Again, you use social media, which is like very top of the funnel. And you drive them to the list. But how do you get them actually to join? If you look on a lot of websites, you see this little tiny thing at the very, very bottom of their web page. It's this little tiny box like we're afraid of it. Like, newsletter. Nobody is going to put anything in there. They don't know what's going on in there. The other thing I see are a lot of noble devs that say these pronouncements like, I only email you when I have a new game. And it sounds noble, like, oh, thanks, dude. But remember, the people who give you their email address love you. They absolutely adore you. It's like, what if you met a cool person, and you gave them their phone number? number and you get in front of me like hey let's hang out this weekend isn't that cool and they said no I'm only gonna call you when I need $20 and you're like what the fuck um no you're cool like let's hang out next weekend no no no no you don't know when you're gonna hear from me it could be six months could be a year two years you don't know then you're gonna hit get it it's $20 that's all you're gonna hear from me it's like who would be that weird friend don't do that to your fan club the way you actually get people to join your email list is with a lead magnet and it's just a little tiny freebie that you give in exchange for an email address and you're thinking bait-and-switch uh-uh no way who falls for that stupid stuff no what if you've ever been to an office and worked in office the most popular person in the office was always the one with a candy jar on their desk and the reason they were so sociable and popular was it's an icebreaker I did that myself like I'd go up and I kind of want some candy today and then I kind of get in conversation I realized they're actually a cool person and I enjoy their company the same thing discoverability and there's a whole discoverability day tomorrow the biggest gap in game marketing is not visibility and discoverability it's actually the interest and all a lead Mac does is bridge that giant gap from somebody being aware of your game to being interested in it it just gets it over that little awkward period so here's a couple examples stray fawn studios they released the game nimbatas and what they did was a demo and get on the demo you just signed up you just gave your email address and you got on the demo that's it they got 50,000 subscribers to their mailing list because of that you can also do stuff like give away your soundtrack say hey if you like our music I'll email it to you just give me your email address you can also do within your game in my game zombie King all my bonus levels where you got all this awesome gold it was only available to subscribers of the email list and it was hugely popular and people signed up for it it's like a special thing just for subscribers okay so you drove traffic to your list let's build a relationship with them and the way you do this is with an auto responder and an auto responder is built into anything like a MailChimp or any other service provider and all it is is just a it's just a programmed set of emails that you pre write and so like when somebody joins a list on let's say Sunday email one is automatically sent to him on Monday and then you can program it so autumn email 2 is sent on Tuesday and email 3 is sent on Wednesday and you can change the duration and you can program it it's like writing dialogue trees and what you do is this is how you introduce yourself like one email might just be welcome let's welcome another one might be tips for your game and then you talk about your company another email might be about you it just slowly introduces people and the reason this is kind of like Game of Thrones like I didn't get into it till like the fifth season or fourth have any there I went back and I rewatched all the episodes in like one epic month it's your autoresponders like that like people probably are finding you for the first time even though you release tons of games before your autoresponder will slowly introduce people you can use it to say hey this was my game I released four years ago there's my game only two years ago you can slowly introduce who you are and catch them up so that they're current with everybody else that's a fan of your games and you might think oh my god that's a ton of emails who would ever open all that this is my autoresponder for zombie King my most opened email is that one you when you have an autoresponder you're slowly building relationship with people and they like you more and more and more by the end of the autoresponder so that's why that's how you get people down the funnel your autoresponder hits the interest desire and action phase that's what it's built for so okay we we drove traffic to our mailing list got him to sign up we built that relationship now it's time to market let's fucking sell sell sell let's get them for every penny you've got just dig in drop the money bomb no do not cash out on your mailing list do not you built a relationship with these people and you got to be gentle with them so we practice something called give give give ask and basically what it is is for what every one email that you send that says like go buy our game or it's on sale that's called action you do all but you have at least done three other emails that are just just content just interesting stories they don't even have a link to go buy anything they're just cool stuff and this is way you should treat your mailing list like you're just this little present wizard who's dropping presents to all the boys and girls like that guy's in the desire phase right there that's what you do that is what your mailing list should look like and this is exactly what Nintendo Power did like all their stuff is like comics they had maps they had cheat codes and like that middle map of Metroid is what sold me on the game like somewhere in there is something called an ice beam I didn't even know what an ice beam was but I knew I had to have that game because somewhere in that game I could find the ice beam like that is what sells people on the game and a perfect example of this is what Kit Fox did for their boyfriend dungeon Kickstarter on their email campaign now full disclosure I consulted with them on how to do this for their Kickstarter but what they did was the it's a game about dating weapons and dungeon fighting but the most attractive thing of course are the dateable weapons and so what they did was they did a series of weekly emails written by each of the dateable weapons and each week you got a different love letter from each one and it told about that that weapon it told their backstory it told about the game it slowly built it up in the story of them from the from the standpoint from the viewpoint of these dateable weapons so each one was just just luxurious and here the results of that dear Kit Fox their community manager Victoria got this email from one of the subscribers to the mail list I signed up for the newsletter and I never got the Isaac one and I would like to because I love these character love letters so could I maybe be recent one show of hands has anybody been ever received an email asking to be marketed to more like does somebody say like please tweet at me more tweets like no but if you write this an engaging way people love it and they will engage with with you and your content and I mean that's one that's pretty hot like that is totally hot like when St. Elmo Lewis was talking about the desire phase I had no idea like this is pretty amazing stuff right okay so this is your fan club treat it one and the biggest myth people ever said like what the biggest tale the devil ever told was that people don't want your email I get emails all the time from Indies are like a very rare dispatch or I hope you don't mind getting this email or I'm invading your inbox once again this is the emails that kitfox crew sent for their Kickstarter they sent six emails I'm also graphing the unsubscribe rate and if you can't see that I'm gonna zoom in right here that one pixel is the unsubscribe graph 2% of people unsubscribe from their emails despite emailing them almost once a week they people love this stuff if you write it correctly so I'm gonna kind of wrap up here this is story time this is me again nine years old love a Nintendo just as link two years ago I had my own son my wife and I had our first child and you know you spent a lot of time just like looking at this sleeping kid and I'm wondering like am I gonna write this am I gonna someday make a shield for my son or make him a little link outfit I don't know but I had to work really hard to get the zombie King out and this is the first game I use this marketing scheme on this email marketing plan and I got it out one month before he's gone before he was born because I knew like okay once he's born dev times over for a little while and so I while I was doing it turns out actually you can do some like answering support emails while the kid sleeps because he sleeps all the time and he and he's trying to get to sleep and eat all the time and this is an email from somebody who was on my mailing list I always subscribe I always to reply to them anytime he said great work on the game my son and I are loving zombie King I was initially very apprehensive but subsequent emails from you have been good and useful and true to your word that you haven't turned into a spam engine I told you guys I told you anyway then I replied back to him immediately because any good dev would and I said thanks for your kind words I think it is so cool that you play with your son my first child was actually born on Wednesday can't wait for him to be old enough so I can play games with him and then this guy emailed me back and he said blank is a big fan of your game and gets the concepts well enough as was most as with most games these days he owns me and shows me how it's done and the reason I blanked out his name that guy's name is my reply was what a coincidence my son's name is the exact same he's actually in my arms as I type this it's like what kind of freaking weird marketing scheme is this where I'm like I'm having dad time with one of my fans like I'm having a bonding moment with somebody like how many times have you learned that your son like has the same name as one of your fans it's like I've done this a long time I've tried Twitter I've tried you know talking to the press and stuff but my god nothing has ever worked where I'm like bonding with my fans and the reason is is because it's a one-to-one communication with email it goes to their inbox it's one person to one person and if you do this right if you're genuine you communicate with people in a kind way you're gonna connect with them and that's all this is all about this isn't cross marketing like upping your CPMs or our poos or whatever it's just connecting with people and that's what I'm trying to teach you all with this email stuff this is the best mechanism for doing it you can you can follow me on Twitter down there I mean I whatever and then how to market my game again I put the directors cut up there whoops and there's my desktop and but anyway um let me keep let me play this again but but you can just get more information about that there I don't know how much time do we have are we done it's the end of the day five minutes of questions let's go for it you in the meanwhile let's give him a warm thank you for the popcorn hi thanks so much for the talk I was wanting to do a question about your unsubscribing so I had on my email list I was trying to send pretty frequent emails and I got very very mixed signals about how often emails were to be sent so some people actually were unsubscribing a lot and then I just asked some friends who were on the email it's like how often do you might I email it you often something to them said absolutely like I'm getting way too much I don't want this much and then other people like like you some consultants were saying no you just email as much as you're gonna email and if they unsubscribe they unsubscribe so can you just maybe comment about that a little bit more yeah up your content game no I'm just kidding like basically here's what I do like for myself I try and email every three weeks and the reason I do that and I don't want to get into this is a whole nother like talk but Google actually rates your emails based on how frequently you send and they actually they reset your good sender score after three weeks so if you don't email for three weeks it kind of reset your like credit score and that's in a bad way so if they if you're sending quality content that people are opening and you keep doing that it actually builds your reputation if you do it every three weeks and I know that sounds frequent but you just got to send like awesome stuff like maybe the and I don't know what your emails are I could actually talk to you afterwards again you guys can contact me anytime this week and I will answer stuff I love this stuff I love that I will talk to you at any time so you can interrupt me but at any time while I'm walking around I'd have to look at them but sometimes it's just like just give them cool stuff that might be better the important thing is you don't want to just sell sell sell and so that's often a problem that that will cause unsubscribes so but yeah I'd be happy to check and see what you did next hey um so what is your best way to get people to your email list I don't know if you have statistics for that but like would you put that box at the top of your website you know your social media marketing yeah a lot of ways here's here's one of the best ways I would say it's like I'm a trailer at the end of the trailer say something like and again advertise your lead magnet you'd be amazed just adding a lead magnet will just boost like in like by an order of magnitude how much more subscriber you get so like at the end of your trailer say hey if you like this art get the free art book sign up for our mailing list and we'll email you this cool concept art just doing that hit them where they are you can also like on social media pin your tweet I pin a tweet that just says hey if you want more information go get this game on there but also forums all kinds of stuff and within your game is also a good way of doing it just because your fans are in there so those are some ideas so you compared emails to Facebook other Twitter other social media but I was wondering if you had any thoughts on a discord that seems to be like the big up-and-coming community engagement tool I I have not tested discord but there's a something fundamental about email because people always check their email and it doesn't scroll like people are pretty good about keeping their inbox clean and just that natural ability will cause them to open and click on more emails the other thing is for some reason just psychologically in the way the software works when people are in email mode they're thinking buying stuff for some reason when they're in discord and social media they're just hanging out with friends it's like a cocktail party and that's why it doesn't always work to advertise within social media because it's like you're coming into somebody's cocktail party and saying hey buy this drink it's you like Tito's alcohol you're gonna like this one that's you're kind of crashing somebody's party in social media but emails all business and they're willing to like pay for stuff that's just a hunch but I feel like discord is also more in the party side of things but that's just a hunch I haven't tested it if anybody has data please email me I had a question two questions we'll see if I can sneak in both but the first one is about the content of the email and getting rated as by Gmail as a promotional email and I wonder whether you feel like oh yeah you should be sending emails that are mostly not rated as a promotion or whether no no you should be in the promotion tab just so everybody understands yeah I'm trying to sell you something but I'm trying to talk about myself you want to get out of that promotion tab as fast as you possibly can there's a whole GDC talk just about how to get out of promotional tab which they probably wouldn't approve because they think this stuff's boring but but the basically about the promotional tab the best way is to show it send short emails that don't have many links and don't have many images one of the worst things you can do is I see a lot of people who won't write their newsletter for like six months and then they talk everything that that studio has been doing for six months and it's all these pictures all these links that hurts your Gmail score because that spammers and and marketers typically load stuff up with images and links keep your very short and simple, and just talk to them like they're human. Don't try and sell, sell, sell, sell. Hey, I just got something new. Talk in first person, like you're, one way that I typically write my emails is I imagine I'm writing to my best friend about my game, and then I just send that to everybody, all of my subscribers, and that does amazingly well. You don't wanna be a formal, like, press release style writing. It's very conversational. Again, it's like a one-to-one communication. And a lot of times, other tricks you can do is you can ask a question, just like, hey, what's your favorite game? If they reply, Google, it tricks Google, and they say, who would ever reply to a spam message? This can't be spam. This is, take it out of the promotional tab and put it in their main tab. That's why, when that person answered and said, hey, could you please send me that missing Isaac email, Google was like, this is a quality email. Who would respond to a marketer's email? And so your whole game as, when you get into email marketing, is trying to get out of the promotion tab and into the real inbox. When you're doing that, MailChimp will let you, you know, use your branded colors and your company logo and your header of your email. It sounds like you were like, no, no, don't do that. It's a feature, but turn it off, turn it off. Just send plain white background, aerial text, no branding. A little bit of branding, but the thing is, I found, I subscribe to all of your email addresses, all your email lists, by the way. I just go through and just try and collect as much data as I can. If I don't hear from you a while, I forget who you are. You're like, Sparking Monkey Studios. I don't remember your games. I don't remember your branding as much, but the thing I do remember are your games. So what I do for my games is I always do like a headline image, just like a header image of the game, whatever game I'm promoting or whatever, and that's more triggering than your studio logo. I know you worked really hard on your studio logos, but they kind of all kind of blend together. The more important thing is I just do one big reminder image of the game I'm promoting, and then I'll link with a call to action. Okay, last question. All right. So I'm subscribed to a lot of newsletter that I like, and I subscribed because I wanted to, but usually when I get to my email, I'm looking for something specific, you know, and a specific email that someone sent me. So there's a lot of newsletter emails that I think would be nice, but I kind of just don't read sometimes. So is there anything that we could do to not make people ignore your newsletter? Like, oh, that's nice, I'm gonna read that later, and that later never comes. Well, like I was saying, give, give, give, and the fact that you're like a little present wizard, like you want to give gifts that people, when they see the subject line, are like, yes, I want that. So one of the first things, like when you sign up for my newsletter within my game, one of the first things I email you is like, here's a tip on how to get more gold. And they're like, yeah, I do want to know how to get more gold. I am definitely opening this. That's what I mean by a gift. Or like, if you've got a really complicated game, like, hey, download this tech tree. That could be like the subject line. Like, hey, you like the tech tree for my game? And then they open it, and they see like a whole tech tree that you've like helped them. Like, that's what all Nintendo Power was. Like, just buy a copy of Nintendo Power and just flip through it. All these pages of like maps and cheat codes, that's the stuff that people want. So if you just put that in the subject line and say, open this email to get that thing, they're gonna be like, yes, that's exactly what I need right now. So you're just giving good things that will help them with your game. So it's easier if you have a very complex game. But I hope that answers. I, again, I will talk about this forever. So even though there's no more questions, if you want to meet me out there, I will talk to you all week. You get a free pass on this stuff. So thank you very much. Thanks for coming. Thank you.
