What's up, guys? Welcome back to another video. Today, I'm going to be talking about a marketing strategy that is used by successful businesses all around the world. However, for some strange reason, it's often overlooked by app developers and game developers. The strategy I'm talking about is called email marketing. This involves collecting potential customers' email addresses, then proceeding to build a rapport with them, and ultimately the goal is to sell them a product or service. The main benefit of building an email list is that it doesn't cost you anything to send out a mass email to everyone on that list. And depending on the products and services that you sell, the potential ROI can be really good. That's why it's important for you, if you aren't already building a list, that you should incorporate this strategy into your overall marketing. Emails also have very good open rates, depending on your subject line and the contents of the email. So if you do it the right way, you send out the email, it lands up in the potential customer's inbox, they like what they see, and then they will purchase your product or service. And yeah, the ROI is really great, considering that it costs you nothing to send that email. There are some do's and don'ts that I have learned when doing email marketing, and as an indie game developer, email marketing has been a huge part of my overall marketing arsenal. So like I said, if you're not doing that already, then I would suggest you start today. What you don't want to do is, when you have an email list, is just constantly spam people with unattractive offers, telling them to download your app now. Bobby, what are you doing? I just want you to touch it. Just touch it, come on. Without actually showing them any benefits, what value it brings to them. So what I found out is that when you are building a rapport with potential customers or past customers, you actually want to build some trust. And trust is only built when you give people value. So the first few emails you should send should just give the customer value. Don't try to sell them anything. Yeah, like I said, just build that trust. Show them the benefits of your app. Show them stories, testimonials, how it's changed people's lives. If it's a game, what makes your game unique? They downloaded your game before and they deleted it. Show them why they should reinstall your game, what updates you've done to improve their overall experience, things like that. So what I have found is that you do need to provide that value to them. Otherwise, they will never open your emails and your open rates will be really low. So once you start providing them value, also make sure that your subject line is very enticing. And what I have found that works best is use, if you look at YouTube, you click on a video because of like a catchy title. It's the same with email. You have to give them something that's kind of like a shock value. When they see it, they want to open that email immediately. And that's going to increase your open rates. Because remember, people are getting bombarded with literally hundreds or thousands of emails per day. So yeah, attention spans are very limited. So you want to make sure as soon as they see that subject line, that they open it and yeah, they go to your offer. What I have found works well when I do new game releases is that I'll run a competition. I'll send out an email and in that email, I will state that I'm running a competition and I will be giving away, for example, a $50 Amazon gift card. All they have to do is go to my social media page and then post their highest score. And within 24 hours, I will select a winner. And I have found when you give them some incentive, not only does it increase the engagement within the game, it also drastically increases the open rate. So I've seen open rates increase 100% to 200% just by giving them a little incentive. And also you funnel people to your social media pages where you can also market to them later down the line. Remember guys, we spend so much time and effort trying to get people to install our app or game only to have them drop off because of bad retention rates and then they are never seen again. So the whole point of building up email lists and collecting players or users email addresses is that we have a way to contact them because obviously we are always updating our apps and we want to give them the best experience and we want to also stay in touch with them and ask them to try it out when we've improved it. So that is also one of the best benefits is getting past users back into your app so you hopefully have another chance of monetizing them again. So I hope you guys enjoyed this video. I hope you got some value. Like I said, if you're not doing email marketing, I highly recommend it. It is your bread and butter at the end of the day if you want to start a serious business.
