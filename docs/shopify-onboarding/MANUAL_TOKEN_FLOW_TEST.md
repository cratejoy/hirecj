# Manual Token Entry Flow - Test Plan

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Redis running locally: `brew services start redis`
- [ ] Auth service running: `make dev-auth`
- [ ] Homepage running: `make dev-homepage`
- [ ] Agents service running: `make dev-agents`

## Test Steps

### 1. Start Fresh Chat
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3456/chat
2. Start a new conversation
3. Note the conversation_id in the URL

### 2. Click Connect Shopify
1. CJ should present the "Connect Shopify" button
2. Click the button
3. Should redirect to Shopify install page

### 3. Install App on Shopify
1. On Shopify's install page, click "Install app"
2. Should redirect to auth service token entry form
3. URL should be: `http://localhost:8103/api/v1/shopify/connected?shop=...&hmac=...`

### 4. Token Entry Form
Verify the form displays:
- [ ] Beta testing notice (blue box)
- [ ] Shop domain shown correctly
- [ ] Clear instructions (6 steps)
- [ ] Password input field
- [ ] "Complete Setup" button
- [ ] Warning about one-time token

### 5. Get Access Token from Shopify
1. Open new tab, go to Shopify Admin
2. Settings â†’ Apps and sales channels
3. Find HireCJ app
4. Click "API credentials"
5. Click "Reveal token once"
6. Copy the token (starts with `shpat_`)

### 6. Submit Token
1. Return to token entry form
2. Paste the token
3. Click "Complete Setup"

### 7. Verify Success Redirect
Should redirect to: `http://localhost:3456/chat?oauth=complete&is_new=true&merchant_id=...&shop=...`
- [ ] OAuth toast notification appears
- [ ] CJ acknowledges connection
- [ ] Shop domain stored in localStorage
- [ ] WebSocket receives oauth_complete message

### 8. Test Invalid Token
1. Start flow again with new conversation
2. At token entry, submit invalid token (e.g., "invalid_token")
3. Should see error page with:
   - "Invalid Token" heading
   - Instructions to check token
   - "Go Back and Try Again" link

## Backend Verification

Check logs for:
```
[SHOPIFY_CONNECTED] App installed for shop: {shop}
[SAVE_TOKEN] Attempting to save token for shop: {shop}
[SAVE_TOKEN] New merchant created: {shop}
```

Check Redis:
```bash
redis-cli
> keys merchant:*
> get merchant:cratejoy
```

## Common Issues

### "Connection refused" on auth service
- Ensure auth service is running: `make dev-auth`
- Check port 8103 is free

### Redis connection error
- Start Redis: `brew services start redis`
- Check Redis is running: `redis-cli ping`

### Token validation fails
- Ensure token starts with `shpat_`
- Token must be from the correct shop
- Token must have required permissions

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Token stored in Redis
- [ ] Frontend receives OAuth parameters
- [ ] Chat continues with authenticated merchant
- [ ] Error handling works for invalid tokens
