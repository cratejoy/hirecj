# Shopify Onboarding - Implementation Documentation

This directory contains detailed implementation guides for each phase of the Shopify onboarding feature.

## Overview

The Shopify onboarding project implements a conversational flow where CJ guides merchants through connecting their Shopify store. The architecture uses Shopify OAuth as the identity gate - no visitor tracking, no spam records.

## Phase Documentation

### üìù TODO Guides
3. **[Phase 3: Quick Value Demo](phase-3-quick-value.md)** - Shopify data fetching, insights display
4. **[Phase 4: Support System Connection](phase-4-support-systems.md)** - Multi-provider OAuth, graceful handling
5. **[Phase 5: Notification & Polish](phase-5-notifications.md)** - Email/browser notifications, error handling
6. **[Phase 6: Testing & Refinement](phase-6-testing.md)** - E2E tests, performance, security review

## How to Use These Guides

1. **Start with the plan**: Read [plan.md](../../plan.md) for the high-level architecture and approach
2. **Follow phases in order**: Each phase builds on the previous
3. **Check prerequisites**: Each guide lists what must be completed first
4. **Use the checklist**: Track progress with the deliverables checklist
5. **Test as you go**: Each guide includes testing steps

## Creating New Phase Guides

Use the **[PHASE_TEMPLATE.md](PHASE_TEMPLATE.md)** as a starting point for creating the remaining guides. The template includes:

- Overview and deliverables
- Step-by-step implementation with code
- API specifications
- Testing checklists
- Common issues and solutions
- Security considerations
- Performance notes

## Key Principles

These guides follow the project's North Star principles:

1. **Simplify**: Clear, straightforward implementations
2. **No Cruft**: Only what's needed for the current phase
3. **Backend-Driven**: Frontend stays thin
4. **Single Source of Truth**: One way to do things

## Architecture Highlights

- **No Visitor Tracking**: Shopify OAuth is the identity gate
- **Natural Conversation Flow**: CJ adapts based on merchant responses  
- **Privacy First**: No data collection before OAuth consent
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, add features as needed
