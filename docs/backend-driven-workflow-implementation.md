# Backend-Driven Workflow Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Automatic Workflow Transitions (`SlackChat.tsx`)
- **Deleted** `handleWorkflowChange` function and its debounce logic (35 lines)
- **Deleted** URL watcher effect that sent `workflow_transition` (22 lines)
- **Deleted** cleanup effect and timer ref
- **Removed** `WORKFLOW_TRANSITION_DEBOUNCE_MS` import

### 2. Removed Workflow Transition Capability (`useWebSocketChat.ts`)
- **Deleted** `sendWorkflowTransition` function (16 lines)
- **Removed** from exports
- **Removed** `WorkflowTransitionMessage` import

### Result: Pure One-Way Data Flow

The frontend now:
1. Receives `conversation_started` with workflow from backend
2. Updates local state and URL via `onWorkflowUpdated`
3. **Never** sends workflow changes back to backend

## Benefits

- **60+ lines removed** - Significant complexity reduction
- **No feedback loops** - Backend update doesn't trigger frontend to send it back
- **No race conditions** - No debouncing, timing issues, or URL watching
- **Single Source of Truth** - Backend owns workflow state completely

## How It Works Now

```
User completes OAuth
    ↓
Backend: "You're now in shopify_post_auth workflow"
    ↓
Frontend: "OK, I'll display shopify_post_auth"
    ↓
Done. No feedback. No loops.
```

## Future User-Initiated Workflow Changes

If needed, add explicit UI:
```tsx
<button onClick={() => wsChat.sendMessage('/workflow support_daily')}>
  Switch to Daily Briefing
</button>
```

The backend would handle this as a command, validate it, and send back the new state via `workflow_updated` message.
