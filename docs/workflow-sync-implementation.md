# Workflow Synchronization Implementation

## Problem Solved
Frontend was sending outdated workflow values (e.g., `shopify_onboarding` after OAuth) that were silently ignored by the backend, creating confusion and violating the "Single Source of Truth" principle.

## Solution Implemented
Frontend now updates its workflow state based on the backend's `conversation_started` message, ensuring both are always synchronized.

## Code Changes

### `/homepage/src/hooks/useWebSocketChat.ts`

1. **Updated `conversation_started` handler** (lines 301-315):
   - Extracts workflow from backend response
   - Updates internal `workflowRef` to keep it current
   - Calls `onWorkflowUpdated` callback to update parent component

2. **Updated `workflow_updated` handler** (lines 317-329):
   - Also updates `workflowRef` for consistency
   - Ensures workflow reference is always current

## How It Works

1. **Frontend → Backend**: Frontend sends `start_conversation` with its current workflow
2. **Backend → Frontend**: Backend responds with `conversation_started` containing the authoritative workflow
3. **Frontend Update**: Frontend updates its state to match backend's workflow
4. **UI Sync**: URL and UI update to reflect the correct workflow

## Benefits

- **Elegant**: Frontend simply follows backend's lead
- **No Silent Failures**: No more ignored parameters
- **Single Source of Truth**: Backend controls workflow state
- **User-Friendly**: URL and UI always show correct state

## Testing

After OAuth completion:
1. Check browser console for "Updating workflow from conversation_started"
2. Verify URL updates to show correct workflow
3. Confirm UI reflects the new workflow state
