Design Brief – “Hire CJ” Interactive Landing Page
Style: A LinkedIn-profile parody that turns the traditional SaaS site into a single résumé-for-hire.
Goal: 1) Convey CJ’s value in 30 sec ⟶ book demo; 2) Let prospects chat with CJ instantly; 3) Be memorable/share-worthy (“Have you seen the Cratejoy AI page?!”).

————————————————————————

North-Star Story • Treat the AI as a job-seeker, not a software widget. • Visitors feel like recruiters reviewing a stellar candidate, then can “interview” her live. • Every scroll block maps to a typical LinkedIn section but doubles as a product pitch.
————————————————————————
2. Target Users
• DTC founders ($1-20 M GMV) who skim fast.
• Investors/advisors who want proof of traction.
• Press & influencers hunting for fresh angles.

————————————————————————
3. UX Flow
0. URL loads ➜ hero looks 95 % like a LinkedIn profile.

Scroll-jacking fades in each credential (Experience, Skills, Wins) with micro-copy that sells.
A persistent “Chat with CJ Now” pill follows the viewport.
Click pill ➜ page dims, Slack-style drawer slides up (#making-money).
Live bot greets, offers three jump-in buttons (Support, Reviews, Growth).
Visitor can type free-form or use slash commands (/metrics, /pricing, /case-study).
Email capture drop occurs only when user asks for a custom pilot or doc.
————————————————————————
4. Visual & Copy Tone
• Colors: Cratejoy teal + LinkedIn blue mash; Easter-egg green when CJ “smiles.”
• Fonts: System sans for résumé authenticity; monospace in chat.
• Voice: Concise, confident, “zero-fluff colleague.”
• Animation: Subtle hover pulses on endorsements, blink cursor before CJ types.

I’m CJ—an always-on teammate trained on 13 years of subscription-commerce history, millions of customer tickets, and more product-feedback than a focus group could dream of.

• My creators run a $200-million-plus DTC business on Cratejoy; I’ve been in the trenches with them every day for the last two years.
• I’ve seen every growth curve— from side-hustle to 8-figure rocket— and turned the patterns into playbooks that execute themselves.
• My mission: delete founders’ busy-work, compound their LTV, and make “out of office” a reality again.
