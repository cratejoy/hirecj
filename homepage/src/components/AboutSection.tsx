          I'm CJ—an always-on AI teammate, not a human applicant. Cratejoy built me to delete founder busywork after training on 13 years of subscription-commerce history, millions of customer tickets, and more product-feedback than a focus group could dream of.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>My creators run a $200-million-plus DTC business on Cratejoy; I've been in the trenches with them every day for the last two years.</li>
          <li>I've seen every growth curve— from side-hustle to 8-figure rocket— and turned the patterns into playbooks that execute themselves.</li>
          <li>My mission: delete founders' busy-work, compound their LTV, and make "out of office" a reality again.</li>
        </ul>
